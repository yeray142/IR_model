This is a very strange series
 It's like a cross between Logan's Run, The Hunger Games, Lost, Lord of the Flies (not to mention M
 C
 Escher) and a number of other dystopian books/movies that have come out over time
 I grant that the way the story is told is somewhat original, and as an example of Korean drama, I suppose it gets a few points for raising that profile



But seriously


WTF!!!!!The dialogue, is addition to being almost juvenile at times, is made even more excruciating by the absolutely horrible, over the top, beyond melodramatic delivery by both the original Korean actors and the those doing the English dub
 But even the scenes in English (the VIPS) was ridiculous, so while this may be intended and a normal quality of Korean cinema, it doesn't automatically make it good or even ok
 My score of 3 is almost exclusively due to this
 It made the show nearly unwatchable
 Maybe this makes more sense in the original Korean and would have been better served by English subtitles
 I don't know
I also question the premise for the show in the first place
 Yeah, times are tough, but would people really be that morally depraved? After the first round when they were allowed to leave, I find it difficult to believe that anyone would come back no matter how difficult their situation was on the outside
 And how could anyone ever possibly emotionally separate their "winnings" from how they were acquired? And while the "1 year later" epilogue does cover this to some extent, I mean really, what kind of horrible, sad, miserable life is Gi-hun going to have? Obviously they're planning a second season, so maybe we'll find out more, but I don't think I really care 
Also, as we learn more about the operation of the contest itself, more questions arise
 First you wonder how they explain all the deaths
 Then when you realize they are harvesting organs, you have to ask why a sudden influx of supposedly anonymous organ donations wouldn't be questioned by someone
 And wouldn't there be a sudden flurry of missing persons reported that the authorities would be looking into? I get it
 It's a fantasy dystopian thing, but I was unable to suspend my disbelief on this point
However, I liked the creepy use of Tchaikowsky's waltz from "Serenade for Strings", Strauss's "Blue Danube" and "Fly Me to the Moon" and found it to be one of the more interesting aspects
But again, seriously





WTF!!!P
 S
 How again is the game court supposed to look like a squid?

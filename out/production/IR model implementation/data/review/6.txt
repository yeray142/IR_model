Haha! I don't know if it's Korea, trolls, fanboys, sheep or IMDb
 Now I have 5 reviews gone
 A pointless review has become a threat to humanity, it seems
 Haha! The next Netflix show should be about a review that triggers people
 If Squid Game can sale this movie would sell too
I don't know what to write anymore
 Okay
 I'll lie
 It's the American thing to do, and that is lie
 Everyone loves a lie that sounds nice
10 = 100This show was so good because it was boring, and I felt stupid watching it
 The voice work felt so natural
 I liked how Tarzan Cameo'd and saved the people in the end
 Believe the hype
 I hope there will be a season 2 of this great show
The show is about a bunch of people dying, and it made me feel happy and smarted up
 Squid Game was very entertaining
Last Words: Squid Game rules!!

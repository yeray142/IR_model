First I hate not having the option of listening in the original language with English subtitles
 No option other than dubbing


my absolute least favorite way to watch
 Now, the acting, or rather overacting big time
 The main protagonist is an absolute waste of space and acts like Jerry Lewis on acid! The overacting and drivel dialogue makes it a ZERO, but not possible here

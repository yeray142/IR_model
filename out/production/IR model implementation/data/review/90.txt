I've watched the whole lot and it's just plain silly
 The cast bring over-acting to a new level, all the characters are spectacularly annoying (I wanted them all to die by Episode 2) and I don't know why I watched it all
 I'm sure there were far better things I could have been doing with my life
 Like cleaning my bathroom or cutting my toe nails
 It's really woeful

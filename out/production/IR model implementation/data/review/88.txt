I didn't want to watch this because the thumbnail on Netflix looked like cheap Money Hiest rip off
 The trailer had me little intriqued but I've had my fair share of battle royale
 Then I watched it and I am so glad I did
This isn't just a rip off of Battle Royale, Hunger games or Alice in Borerlands
 This series speaks of the lives, desperation and morality of poor people vs the rich and their filth
 Almost as if it was inspired by The Parasite
 It's not the first time we have seen the wealthy bet on the poor but this time it's executed well
 The deep dive into different characters and their plight really works here
 This time it's not just the players but we get to peek into staff and leaders too
 The motive makes sense
 It's not just filthy rich making poor fight
I liked how they took the childhood games and put a deadly spin on it
 When it gets dark it really does get dark
 I had a couple of people I was rooting for
 My favorite character is player 001
 I instantly fell in love with his character and almost all the scenes he is in, are delightful to watch
All the actors have done great job
 There are characters you hate, some that are just so annoying you wish they were dead, heroes, faux heroes, unfortunates, unlucky
 Technically this movie is well made violence and gore is not gratuitous
 Twists are well written, editing could've been tighter, cinematographer captures the South Korean streets and lives well enough, background score was okay
 Humor is well knitted
This is a must watch on Netflix
 I doubt there will be a season two and there isn't any scope of it

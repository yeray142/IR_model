I guess I got sucked into the hype around this and was curious about this show, the premise looked fun so I went for it
 I finished it in 2 days, which is a testament to the show I guess, but it didn't leave me satisfied
Individually it has some great episodes
 But the overall story is weak, and spends too much time with mumbling about irrelevant things
 This being most prominent with the whole cop storyline
 It's very poorly done and has no payoff whatsoever
 It seemed like a excuse just to show some of the workings inside the facility
 I wish they cut out the cop plot completely because it was worthless
The directing is good overall, not the greatest but it is a visually appealing show, but this is more so caused by the superb set design
 This show definitely has a few ''wow'' moments when shown a new area or room
 This also made the next games a lot more interesting and made you curious for how the next game looks
Now the games themselves, the marble game is simply the best because of its drama, and the most striking I think is the first game
 Besides that, the other games aren't that great
 Mainly due to the poor CGI
Now there is a ton of gore and blood here, and most of it is good
 But you can notice when it gets sloppy
 The main offenders are the CGI used for people when they fall
 It looks very unrealistic and low quality if that makes sense
 It's not a convincing effect and a couple of games use that it makes them a lot less fun to watch
The acting was great for the Korean actors
 The VIPs are another story, now I wouldn't say their acting was bad
 But the dialog that was written was horrible
 It felt like a parody of how rich people talk, when that was obviously not intended
The finale, the answers we got were lackluster, there are a couple of plotholes, the reveal was alright though, I liked that
 But then


 unless the hair change is a symbol for something I don't get it, and the airport scene felt rushed
Overall it's a fun series but don't look to far into it
 It's got good fx, nice acting and amazing set pieces, but that's that
 (watched in Korean language, not dubbed)

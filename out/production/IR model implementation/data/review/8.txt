A great concept here as desperate people with financial problems compete for a huge sum of money(apparently $38 mil American)
 They must play games against one another with a severe penalty for losing
 Like the Sopranos, with some of the episodes better than others
 Number six was the best for me
 The sets are Wes Anderson like, with bright colors filling the screen
 The lead actors are excellent and the scripts very well written
 The violence is over the top with no comic relief in sight
 The final episode was a bit of a letdown but overall I was highly entertained

Finally finished this series
 This is series is sticky, i mean it stick viewer toward, full of suspense, i really enjoy its game and i didn't expect that last game ends so easily in that's point i didn't satisfy
 However i think they also made 2nd season after seeing its ending gin hun (lead character) didn't take the flight
 GOOD series

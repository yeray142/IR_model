I tend to argue that when South Korean creators are at their peak, they're giving 150%
 This intensity and occasional brutality (these works hold back neither in terms of raw emotions being expressed nor the violence being depicted) means that films like Secret Sunshine and Oldboy, while close to flawless, don't necessarily find pop-culture success the world over
But we live in different times, and the world is about to realize that there is more to South Korean media than bouncy BTS videos, more so than when Parasite arrived and gave the Korean Wave a considerable push
 For all their problems, we can thank Netflix for this -- once again they grant something truly special and creative a platform
I was incredibly excited to watch Squid Game, even though I at first deemed it "suspiciously popular"
 What was it? One of those rare pieces of media that's clever, unique, and layered enough to please smart viewers but accessible enough to be "hip", or a preachy, obvious miniseries that blew the minds of those who haven't seen this type of art yet? (Or maybe those who only watched it because Korean media is the current "cool" thing to consume and didn't grasp the larger point -- there are articles that smugly point out things that don't make sense about the setting, which, as per the show's themes and social satire, aren't supposed to make sense)
Ultimately, Squid Game (original title Ojing-eo Geim) proved to mostly be the former
 That is, a piece of pop-culture art that works on one level for the astute, analytical viewers and another for, well, everyone that likes to be entertained, surprised, and disturbed (including the ones, then, who don't understand it and enjoy it "in spite of some plot holes")
At a glance, one might dismiss it as a mixture of The Hunger Games and Saw, but it mops the floor with both of those franchises -- in the technical and stylistic departments, as well as in exploring what humans may do at their most desperate (it's also a better social metaphor than The Platform)
 A varied cast of debt-ridden lowlifes is taken to a secret location (that looks like something out of a Kubrick film), supervised by interchangeable men in masks, to partake in children's games for a reward of 45 billion won
 However, should they lose, the penalty is instant death
This becomes very clear very soon, and so the participants are -- get this -- simply given the choice to leave
 It's around this point that the series goes from entertaining and original to downright fascinating/thought-provoking
 I won't reveal too much, but you can probably guess that the game doesn't end at episode 2 of 9
 Subsequent episodes reveal even more about its players; about the desperation inherent to the modern nightmare
The characters are an instantly memorable bunch; horrible in some ways (when at their most desperate), yet ultimately pitiable
 We go from loathing the down-on-his-luck Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) to rooting for him and his eventual team; the stone-cold Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) may be warmer than we suspect, and the dementia-ridden "Player 1" (O Yeung-su) harbors strategic insight
 There are hidden depths (good and evil) to just about everyone
There is a cleverly constructed twist regarding one particular character
 I was able to guess it, pretty much as a joke, but the clues leading up to it made me realize I might not be joking
 Squid Game has tremendous rewatch value and this is one of the reasons
Some of what we see does feel a bit superfluous; a few subplots go nowhere and certain character deaths, due to the nature of the game, feel somewhat obvious
 That being said, the in-universe game seems highly deliberate -- designed in such a way that only so many players could ever make it to the end -- and some of the deaths in especially the Gganbu episode are among the most heart-wrenching; a simple game of marbles is turned into one of the tensest, most heartbreaking hours of TV/streaming I've seen in years (the games, in general, are a masterclass of set-piece craft)
 It's not as unpredictable as Game of Thrones (back when it was smart) in terms of just who will perish, but it's hardly contrived that a story focuses on those who made it the furthest
 This isn't the same as Plot Armor
My only other big complaint concerns some of the later episodes, where it starts to feel a lot more like a Hunger Games sequel, complete with cartoonish Rich People??from across the world, including ones who speak American English (as written by someone whose first language is decidedly not English)
 And yes, I will concede that some plot conveniences/contrivances are exactly that, but they usually serve the show's poetry and dramatic timing
Still, Squid Game is quite the piece of work and I could praise it for far longer than I already have
 Its success sets a good precedent
 Like Parasite (another far-reaching showcase of South Korean vigor), Squid Game is entertaining and tense enough that general audiences won't be alienated by its morbid strangeness, while being well-written, well-acted, well-scored, visually unique, multilayered, varied, and complex enough to enrich their palette -- whether they watch because it's "cool" or not
 Still, it's hard to say (especially when a work is this popular) if all these people truly gleaned the show's message
I'm told that some of the in-universe games are being widely mimicked by teenagers on TikTok, and for what it's worth, the mainstream reaction could've been much worse
 (My generation isn't much smarter than Zoomers -- think of when we aspired to replicate the catastrophic house party in Project X
) We might see the usual irony of major companies trying to cash in on the popularity of a show with these themes, but what I'm truly spaeing is for Elon Musk or whatever to take a look at this and go "Squid Game, huh? That sounds pretty neat!"

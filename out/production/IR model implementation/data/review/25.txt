For those who did not understand the psychological projection of the series
 Basically, The series discusses the brutality of the capitalist economy system in such a clever way that you'll definitely notice and say when you're watching "that character is me!"
It is that under the dominance of the capitalist system all people are in a race to get money that only one person takes in the end
 The same money that come from the blood and sweat of others
The capitalist system claims that there is equity And justice in the distribution of the wealth
 And this is far from the truth
As for the big capitalists who control the big capitals and companies that run the entire process, money is no longer their pleasure
 That they only find pleasure in people suffer

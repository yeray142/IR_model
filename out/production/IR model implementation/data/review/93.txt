Episode 1 was AMAZING!!!But things went downhill a little bit each episode
 By episode 4, I was totally over it
I did watch all 9 episodes, because I'd already invested so much time into it
 Plus, I wanted to see what all the social media hype was about


unfortunately, after all 9 episodes, I'm not seeing it
Didn't really need to be 9 hours long


would of worked better as one regular 90-minute film

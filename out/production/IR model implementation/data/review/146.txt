What I liked about itVery addicting for most of the series
 Couldn't let go of it
Except for a couple actors, I thought the overall acting was pretty good
 MINYU was particularly noticeable - super obnoxious character
Plus points for pulling off a genre that wasn't attempted in K-dramas before
The set and the overall color of the series
 Very vibrant color in contrast to the rather grotesque story the series portrayed
 Loved that
Decent ending for the games
 Was an unexpected ethos of arriving to a rather predictable conclusion
Just the right amount of gore for my taste
----What I didn't like about itVIPs were so cringe
 I suppose it's hard to find decent English speaking non Korean actors in Korea
 They were truly atrocious
Unclear messaging
 Maybe not unclear - just a bit messy job conveying the message
Ep 8-9 were a little dragged on - could have had faster pace
The cop storyline was a little off-putting
 Wish we saw more depth and development in there

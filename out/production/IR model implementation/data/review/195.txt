I caught this on Netflix and it was a phenomenal series! I wasn't even sure I would like it but I ended up loving it! This is a creative storyline that gets pretty twisted but they were still able to add in some real sentimental parts that were surprising
 Also has some mind blowing twists in it
 Be prepared episode 6 is a rough one
 I couldn't believe how much you end up liking certain characters so when those certain ones were eliminated it gets really upsetting
This ended where they could do another season so I looked it up to see if there were plans for it but there isn't yet
 I read the director actually wrote every episode himself on top of directing it
 He said if he does do another season he would use a writers table asks other seasoned directors
Do not miss out on this series!

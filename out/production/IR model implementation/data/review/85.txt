If you've already watched Alice in Wonderland and As Gods will, you're gonna be disappointed
The first 4 episodes were good, the plot was promising
And then came the Second half, which felt rushed and the writers out of ideas




The plot with the VIP was already seen many times and it felt awkward and ridiculous
 And the rest was over dramatic and the "plot twists"/reveals so typical



I felt like I've wasted my time with this series

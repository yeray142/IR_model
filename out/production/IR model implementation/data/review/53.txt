A large group of people who are down on their luck are invited to a game where all their money troubles can be solved
 The only thing they don't know is that it will be a bloody battle for survival and they will each learn how far they will go just to survive
 It is a little predictable in the overall concept but does have some surprises in leading up to the finale
 Well acted and a reasonable pace over 9 episodes with a few plot twists keeps your attention

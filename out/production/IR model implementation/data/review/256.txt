I've watched a ton of Korean series and films and to say this was good is overstating
The premise, the storylines are nothing new, it's been done a lot over the years
Just has more CGI Bells and Whistles
Sorry, but I can't recommend this slop
Easy to figure out that The Front Man was the cop's brother



Lots of blood and headshots



I was stunned that the bathroom sex scene was there



None of the characters made you actually like them or pull for them



If they make another season


that's punishment enough

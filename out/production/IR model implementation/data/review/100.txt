As survival series go, "Squid Game" brought with it something familiar - a game-show setting with a mindblowing cash prize for the winner - and infused it with a "Hunger Games", "Saw", and other story-telling flavours that felt human in several regards
 The show made me genuinely feel for and think about the people involved instead of just watching them go through what they did like an inert spectator
The stakes were high, but so were the perils - especially of the moral kind
 The parts where they delved into the Human psyche and captured multiple facets of what different kinds of people are willing to do to win financial freedom


 This part, more than anything else, made this Korean survival-thriller series feel at once relatable and well-scripted
The show came close to relying on clich챕d tropes and boring plot-elements, but somehow Dong-hyuk Hwang evaded all those loopholes and 'convenience zones'
 He also scripted the series, adding to his credence as a visual communicator extraordinaire
Every cast member was excellent, and their performances were on point
 Neither one eclipsed the other, in fact each brought something significant to bear on this storyline
 The thrills were carried on their performances, and they all did great work
Jaeil Jung's musical scoring more than 'made it work' where this series was concerned
 He captured all the right emotions by hitting all the right notes
 That ominous choir-orchestra tone he relied on often


 That never got old, and routinely perked my sense of suspense
Great work also on set and production design, as well as costumes
 These, and other crew departments, including cinematography (strangely unlisted on IMDB), conveyed a sense of complexity and elaborateness by keeping it counter-intuitively simple and theme-centric
A few negatives


 There were no cameras in the restrooms
 This particular place given its peculiar goings-on should have certainly had them installed there
 No cavity checks of the prisoners - that was another 'tricky' omission
 The highly trained guards were otherwise not immediately suspicious when one of their own started to act out of protocol
 However, these and a handful of other 'loopholes' were needed to progress the plot and did not feel contrived - emphasis on that word, that's where the magic lay in this series
I highly recommend watching all nine episodes in their original Korean-language (non-dubbed) version
 Feel free to rely on subtitles to stay informed
 That's how I watched "Squid Game" on Netflix
 The 'feel' was so much different than when I 'tested' a few minutes of the show in its English dub
Being in debt is no joke, it truly destroys lives and families, even entire friendships and romances
 This series captured the sheer helplessness of being in debt, and it did so through its characters
 It also captured the depths of human depravity, and what some people with too much money are willing to do
With Netflix's "Squid Game" Dong-hyuk Hwang has made a 'dark' mark one won't soon forget
 He proved how artfully you can take a clich챕, or something familiar, and twist it into something new
 "Squid Game" had that in abundance, and made me feel like I was watching something genuinely artistic and soulful
 The show went deep into the primal nature of Humankind instead of just showcasing our 'better nature'

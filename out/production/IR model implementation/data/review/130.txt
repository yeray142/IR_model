First of, I am glad to see this is an ongoing trend, non-English movies making their way to become global phenomenon reaching a wider audience, which allows us to get fresh perspectives on reality from different nations around the world
The concept of Squid Game in itself is nothing new, a bunch of unsuspecting individuals getting caught up in a game which they quickly learn might have some severe consequences; on the other hand, the way the concept is explored does bring some fresh perspectives
The main character is easily relatable, and as we understand the struggles he had to go through he becomes an instant character success; another positive aspect of the show is the stunning set and production design, you can see a lot of work was put into it, almost no VFX are used and the sets were actually built
It starts strong, you get attachment to the characters, most of them do a really great job on the acting skills, even though from time to time there's some weird overacting going on, which is hard to distinct if it has any hidden meaning behind and even with the slow episodes you will be interested to see how the story unfolds
As we get to the finale however that's a different story, not only it's an anti climatic slow episode, but also seems to decide to go for a direction which doesn't make much sense based on the previous events

Without giving any spoilers, the main twist it's not only a bit predictable but also ruins one of the previous and most emotional episode of the show
Also the main character decision in the last minutes also seems to be completely irrational and not at all inline with his core motivations, the whole point of him joining the game is thrown out the windows in a matter of seconds
Still I did enjoy it for the most part, I don't think it's overhyped, they could've made some better decisions with the ending but then again this is always an inglorious task no matter which series you make, worth the watch regardless

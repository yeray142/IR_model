Just finished up SQUID GAME, the Korean TV show that's become a global smash hit on Netflix
 It's truly brilliant and even better than the similar Japanese show ALICE IN BORDERLAND! The show is centred around contestants competing in children's games for a cash prize, but the twist is that they get killed if they lose
 Shades of SAW and THE HUNGER GAMES here, but this is rivalled only by BATTLE ROYALE in terms of sheer quality
 As usual for Korea, the writing, acting, and direction are all superb and the games themselves are hugely suspenseful, unlike anything I've seen before
 Definitely horrifying enough both in premise and in terms of violent bloodshed to count as horror too

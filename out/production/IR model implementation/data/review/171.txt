If you are wondering if this show is worth of all the hype, it is
Just a few flaws for me: the cop sub plot feels silly; and as usually in korean dramas, when they need white characters (the VIPs here - by the way, could you imagine a US show were all the villains would be POC?) they cast the same bunch of untalented dudes
 Their acting is so bad that i really wonder if they are truly actors or if there are just white dudes livng in Korea

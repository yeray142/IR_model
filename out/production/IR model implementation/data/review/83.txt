Watch the first episode if you can't resist the marketing hype
 You'll see it's a 3/4
 But since these few points - due to the fresh storyline - are undeserved (it's heavily inspired by the manga-anime Kaiji, and still succeeds in throwing away its most brillant elements by replacing them with blood and scenographies), I'll give it a 1
Abysmal overacting, puppet characters, unrealistic and unrefined stuff
 Even teens (which are the main target), once the novelty factor fades, will recognize that it's trash

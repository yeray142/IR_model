This isnt one of them
 There were some great characters, but sadly, they were wiped out til only the dregs remained
 They dregs weren't much better than the English speaking vips that had to be the most poorly cast actors in the history of the universe
 The end was fitting
 Bleak
 The movie was bleak
 Bleak can be good, but there needs to be a point
 There wasn't one here
 I cared not a lick about those that remained
 This was a terrible waste

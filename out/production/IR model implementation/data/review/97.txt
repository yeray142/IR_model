Among other things, the writer/director stresses several times how the players are 'equal' and must be treated fairly
 Then near the end, when the 3 finalists cross the glass bridge successfully, he has the bridge panels explode with great ferocity and causes the young woman to be seriously wounded (and later has her killer explain that it was a mercy killing


 that she was terminally wounded
 That's hardly fair, don't you agree?The very old man who turns out to be Mr
 Big was part of a tug of war game which was not rigged
 That means if the winners (unbelievable by the way that they could win against a physically stronger team) lost he would have perished in the fall
 Incongruous story mistake
Several semi-finalists, the young woman for instance and one finalist commit suicide, the former unbelievable since she has a mother and brother she wants to save, the latter unexpectedly since he was shown through the competition to do anything to win
I also believe it makes no sense for the VIP's to only show up at the end
 Surely the millions of dollars they spend would mean they would want to see every bloody (and I do mean bloody) minute of all the games
I also found making all of the VIP's Americans prejudicial
 You mean all the world's class exploitation exists only in the 1 percenters who are American?

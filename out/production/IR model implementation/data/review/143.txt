I really wanted to enjoy this series after all the hype, but just found it lacking in any real substance
 There is a very linear story line, people in a lot of debt get invited to play some very basic games
 Twist is, they get killed if they don't win
 That's it
 There is some initial shock during the first game, but that wanes as the series progresses
 There are a some semi-interesting, but predictable back stories, and most of the characters have few, if any redeeming features, so you don't really care who survives
 It is easy to be seduced by the initial shock of the first reveal, but it really doesn't progress much from there
 I'd recommend
 Midnight Mass on Netflix if you want some real horror

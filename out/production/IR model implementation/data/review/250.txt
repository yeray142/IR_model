The premise and aesthetic of the show had me hooked already
 Lots of mystery
 Love-able and hate-able characters
 The "games" they play are always intense and you hope your favourites survive
It was quite emotional too, there's times where you have to be deceitful to your allies
Really great show all round
 Although the VIP's had atrocious acting when they were introduced around EP 7
 Really took me out the immersion for an episode
Other than that it was amazing, I love Korean shows and you don't get many on Netflix, so I hope the show does well so we see more
TL;DRIt's great, watch it

Yes this can be seen as a dystopian fiction
 Like Maze Runner, Hunger games, you name it
 But the fact that they put children's games into the mix was a concept that was pulled off very well and in a way that made you feel a major amout of tension
 I can only hope that this gets renewed for Season 2
 If not then it had a hell of a run

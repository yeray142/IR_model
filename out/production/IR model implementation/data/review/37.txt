Hype that will not stand up with time
 This series does not measure up to the standards of good, much less great, Korean Drama
 The cast is excellent, of course (except for the VIPs, though the inside joke on American actors is rich), but the plot is predictable from the beginning through to the end
 From the moment 001 (the old man's number is a heavy-handed hint) showed up, the repetition mixed in with violence and gore was evident, and the outcome was always predictable
However
 Blessings on Netflix for bringing international film to the world, especially during the pandemic
 But don't try to own it, guys: just stream it

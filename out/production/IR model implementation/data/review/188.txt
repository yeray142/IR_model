I put it on my watchlist because I absolutely love korean thrillers
 I love the style and the type of writing the screenplay of almost every korean thriller and drama
 Then I went to vacation and when I came back the hype about this series was incredible
 I hope that more people love korean movies and series now as much as I do
 Very nice, didn't disappointed and is as good as I expected when putting it on my watchlist

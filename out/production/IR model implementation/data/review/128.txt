The show is essentially a show that begins with a realistic interpretation of the psychological aspect of a "battle royale" life or death game where people are desperate and motivated by the insurmountable debt they have accumulated
 It quickly throws this idea away half way through the show where the money doesn't matter, life is more important than money, and winning a life or death game with a "good heart" will show the true winner
 This is the Asian concept that I put in my title that I thought was too melancholy for my taste and ruined the realism of peoples actual reaction to this type of turmoil
The first game in the first episode is a game of red light; green light, where if you are eliminated you are shot
 Over 200 people die and they barely win a vote to get off the island because they did not expect the games to be this inhumane
 This is a respectable understanding and it made sense for the story
 But many of the people who voted to leave, found out that their debt back home was ruining their lives more than they remembered and choose to reenter into the games
This is where the show starts to get too stereotypical for me
 The games don't matter because plot armor is already established and they instead treat the games like they are "forced" to be there and must win by being the most compassionate and caring of all the players
 This makes no sense and is contradicting when they chose to be there not once but twice
All instances of life and death situation is thrown out the window and many pretend that everyone is of good nature and, "we can win this with everyone still alive"
 Then they turn one character into a psychopath because he did what he had to do while actually playing the games and then ACTUALLY turn him into a psychopath purely to make a "final boss" enemy in the show
I won't spoil everything in the show if you choose to watch it but they also have a lot of " saw that coming" and "give me a break" plot twists in the show that I thought were reminiscent of the Asian cinema stereotype and it kind of ruined the show for me
 But the show deserved at least a 5 or 6 at the least
 But knowing Netflix, they will make a second season off of this because of its popularity when its not needed and ruin the entire story line even further

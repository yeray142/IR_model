Really good show and I enjoyed most of it, all the main characters were great and the acting was also great, the only problem I had was the VIPs, they were really weird and for such a good show you'd think they could get better actors for these characters
 I also think the ending could have been better
Other than that I really enjoyed the show and it's probably one of the best Netflix originals, and the best I've seen this year

A battle royale-style concept that's been done many times in different forms (e
g
, Alice in Borderland, 3%, Hunger Games, etc
), but there's just something in the way that Korean artistic style makes even the most cliched story lines interesting again
 The first episode felt a little sluggish, but gets going by the end, and boy does it get going!The show is thoroughly enjoyable and gripping to watch, but gets predictable towards the end
 Not only that, I think the writers ran out of shocking novel ideas about how to stage the namesake game in the end
 But by then, you may just appreciate the relief of a straight-forward conclusion
Definitely binge-worthy! Though they could make a sequel/season 2, I don't think they should--it doesn't really need it, nor leaves you wanting more

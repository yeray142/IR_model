This show was like a mixtape of other (and better) shows
 You can virtually see the Netflix algorithm in action: "The capitalism parable in Parasite won an Oscar, so let's go with that
 And people responded really well to the colorful uniforms and weird masks in Casa de Papel, so let's give people a chance to dress up as our characters on Halloween which will give the show free PR
 Oh, and Battle Royale was really successful and influential, so let's pretty much steal that whole concept right down to the classical music and cheery female speaker!"The VIPs get a lot of flak for their acting in many reviews on IMDb, and rightly so
 But let's be honest, the Korean actors are no better
 This show is filled to the brim with bad Asian style overacting, something which is far too common in Korean and Japanese shows
 The bad guy with the face tattoo is right out of some school play, and the guy in the lead is pulling faces like a madman
 I have no idea who they are but I wouldn't be surprised if they originally are comedians
 The best actor in the whole show is the main character's daughter and she's only in it for a couple of minutes
As per usual for a Netflix production the story is stretched very thin in order to make it nine hours (!) long

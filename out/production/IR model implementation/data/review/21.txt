Fly Me to the Moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like on
A Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss meNow imagine listen to that calming jazz melody, sipping some wine, and watching more than 400 people getting murdered playing some kid's games
A brand new Netflix Korean thriller
 This is kinda like Korean version of Alice in Borderland
 However, the twist to the familiar premise was amazing
 Most of the games were incredibly nerve-racking
 The first and fourth games were for sure my favorite
 They made me grabbing my pillow, while showing cruel ways desperate people resorted to do to save themselves
 Because of this, whenever the game started, I became excited and more thrilled
However, the characters were for the most part generic and categorical
 Honestly I didn't care much for them, and just wanted the games to start
 However, some of them actually had some sad stories, like the two girls in game number four
 Then, near the end there's these English-speaking VIPs that were annoying as heck mostly because of the unnatural way they talked
 I'm not sure why they had to speak like they are the final bosses
 There's also a subplot about a cop, which didn't pay off well enough at the end
Overall, despite the straightforward characters, I still had an amazing time with this show
 Pretty sure season 2 will be made because not everything was resolved
 8/10#**THIS PART IS SPOILER SO STOP OF DON'T WANT SPOILER**Well of course, game 4, the marble games, was the best one because the stuff that the characters pulled to fool the others were sad and shocking
 Then game 1, red light green light, was shocking and fun
 Probably the most nerve-racking one out of all of them
 Then game 5, the jumping glass, was also intense as heck
 Game 2 wasn't as intense, but still bloody
 When it was revealed, I and the main guy realized how screwed he was
 Then game 3, tug of war was fine, but the tricks were pretty surprising
 Gotta equip those tools
 Finally, game 6 was lackluster and didn't have as much impact as I wanted
 It was over a bit too quickly and didn't feel special
 But yeah, that's my ranking of all the rounds in this first season

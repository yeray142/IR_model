Really fun concept of a show that takes time to develop the characters and make you care and understand them before the games begin
 Started very strong up until episode 6, then went downhill with all the VIP stuff and plot twists and turns that undermined characters and story stuff earlier on
 Has great production values and acting
 Episode 6 was the best one by a mile, but the last three episodes were pretty weak overall and makes me a bit worried how Season 2 will turn out
8/10 for Season 1

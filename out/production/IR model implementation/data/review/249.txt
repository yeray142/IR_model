It started good but end up pretentious
There were many things left unexplained like
1- the videos were already sent to police 
2- how did the cop's brother become a master and for what 
3- there were people who's supposed to take the MC kidney, but somehow and even though he never paid them back ( since he never used the money ) after a year , he still had his kidneys 
4- I don't remember how many players were there but how did they manage to split into groups of tens
 It doesn't make any sense 
5- the cop that was shot, the body will be found and even if it didn't , he would still be remain missing, which is a huge problem since he's a cop not just a citizen
6- when the old man told his assistant to excuse him from watching the game with the vips and wanted to play with the players, the vips only watched the glass game and the old man was expelled earlier so this doesn't make sense eitherI don't know what is it with Korean drama but they always mess it up , they start good but finish badly , the acting the story line , the plot holes 
My god every time they show us the English speakers characters , I just want to throw up 
 The whole scene , the decorations , who the heck thought of that , why ruin it 
And I must finish with , if you're gonna watch this , you should watch the movie serie saw instead , it's better anyway , since this was a huge rip off
I wished that the girl would have won 

 and that the MC would have ended just as greedy and betrayer as others , it would be a better story line and very unexpected since she was only a side character

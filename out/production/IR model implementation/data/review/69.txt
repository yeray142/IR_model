If you watched any of the most recent dystopian movie likes Hunger Games then you can pretty much figure out that no one is going to win in this
 It is made clear that there is only going to be one winner so all the supposed teams are going to end badly so the friendships made are for the sole purpose of making the audience feel something
 It kinda does work but it makes you feel manipulated at the same time
This is not a bad show and I can see why people like it
 It has all parts to a great Netflix Original but I just felt manipulated while watching it

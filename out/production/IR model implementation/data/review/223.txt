Pros: acting, art direction, visuals, detailed storytelling
Cons: filler scenesWith more than a decade in making, Director Hwang Dong-hyuk has nailed this series, possibly allowing for more Korean creators to explore this genre
The acting by many of the characters in the show has been phenomenal
 Their backstories were believable and emotional because of the emotions they conveyed (if being watched with original Korean audio + English subtitles, instead of English dub)
The artistic design throughout the movie was aesthetically pleasing and creative as color choices in many scenes are intentionally done
 And with that being said, the attention to detail carries this show beautifully
The only complaints while watching were the filler scenes; making the show feel as though it's dragging at some points
 Some complained about the acting of the VIPs, but I think that was intentionally done by the creators

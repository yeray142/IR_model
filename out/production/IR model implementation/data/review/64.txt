While the series deserves its enthusiastic reception for creating a tense atmosphere - although it seriously drops off towards the end, so don't expect too much -, the premise and story heavily borrow from the manga "Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji", which has been running from 1996
 It's been adapted various times, first as an anime series in 2007
 Which is when director Hwang Dong-hyuk admittedly started writing "Squid Game"
The similarities are too obvious to be ignored: the protagonist is an unemployed compulsive gambler (!) who finds himself whisked off to a ship in the middle of the ocean (!!), where he has to play increasingly daring games against other indebted people (!!!)
 They build teams to weather competition, and in the end they have to cross a glass bridge (!!!!)
 Creator Nobuyuki Fukumoto and publisher Kodansha have a strong case for copyright infringement as the credits fail to mention this "inspiration"
There have also been three movies based on the series (from 2009, 2011 and 2020) which are not very good as the acting leaves much to be desired
 "Squid Game" definitely satisfies in this department, although it's not a masterpiece like Lee Chang-dong's "Burning" (2018) or the Oscar-winning "Parasite"
 But the audacity of this rip-off leaves a sour aftertaste, as it would if Bong Joon-ho would do a superhero movie called "The Vengeancers"

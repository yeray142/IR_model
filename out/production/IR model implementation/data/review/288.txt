Squid Game could have been an amazing show, but at an average of 55 episodes, it's filled with so much bloat
It needed to be 6-8 half hour episodes
It is fantastic, stylishly shot and has so much going for it, but boy does it need an edit
 Episode 2 was entirely pointless and ridiculous in the extreme
So much I could say, but I'd love to see a vastly cut down version, or a 2 hour movie - the running length is really the only thing spoiling what could have been truly legendary

The first episodes hit you like a hard punch in the stomach
 Original and well produced series
 Disturbing, bizarre and unpredictable
 Many very good characters with the big exception of the VIP people that were very bad acting
 Korean filmmakers show more and more their ability to make high quality dramas
 You are kept on the edge of your seat for the first half of the series
 Then it loses some steam and focus
 The ending a bit disappointing and the opening for a second seasons feels totally unncessary
 One season is enough and it is a very good watch for the not-faint-hearted-viewers

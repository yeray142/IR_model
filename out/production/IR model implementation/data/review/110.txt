Man who made this and this is so emotional when grandpa knew he was cheating but gave it all up saying ganbu buddies stay and share together and so was ali who paid a price for his innocence
I wished like every show the good guys has a chance but no this one is realistic as hell
On episode 6 made me cry i miss my dad seeing gramps 
Bruh they got me in the first half I'm not gonna spoil the spoiler but I did cry for nothing

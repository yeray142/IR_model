This show's massive popularity, especially among young Netflix viewers, conveniently exposes that audience to the kind of childhood they had all missed out on - playing games outdoors with other neighborhood kids instead of just sitting on the couch watching Netflix
 It is pretty clever in that way, yet that is just the beginning, as this show's multi-layered subject matter and plot line are executed so well that "Squid Game" guarantees you to be on the edge of your seat
 There is plenty of action, suspense, and that occasional gore, but all of those exciting scenes are just a backdrop to the heart-wrenching storyline filled with irony, philosophy, and a message with a punch
 "Squid Game" is a cinematic experience that stays with you, similar to movies like "Pulp Fiction," and I am glad that it has inched up to the number one spot in Netflix, instead of being lost in the enormous library of mediocre shows that uninspired people watch just to waste time
 With "Squid Game," you will not be wasting time
 I guarantee it

This is an entertaining series from South Korea that embodies elements of Korean Soap Opera, Chinese Operatic acting and Japanese theater
 It uses classical Chinese opera techniques such as the wide open eyes to portray fear and anger



and a lot of shouting
It uses "Hunger Games" as it's base and survival of the fittest as its main theme
 The story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode 4
 It then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode
 It is set up for a second season (if one can judge from the final episode) but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven Have to agree with the other comments about the group of "actors" playing the VIPs
 They obviously came cheap and might not even have been actors at all! Enjoyable for what it's meant to be!

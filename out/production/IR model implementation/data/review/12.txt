09/23/2021 The first few episodes were fun to watch as they played out but as the series progressed, a more serious, ominous storyline starts to unfold due to viewers empatheticly connecting with a few of the characters facing uncertainty as the game continues, even possible death? I found the series in the overall really great, refreshingly new and well planned out as it unfolded
 I hope that somehow the series will continue on into the future with many more seasons to come? A great show from my perspective!

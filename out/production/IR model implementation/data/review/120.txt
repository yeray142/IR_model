Cube, Escape Room, The Cabin in the Woods, The Hunger Games



etc! Seems that mortal combats for the pleasure of elites has become very popular lately
Well, to be honest, it could have been so much better if it was made in America

 Sometimes it falls so deeply into its childish play you may wonder if the show has been made for juniors
Final thought: a very entertaining miniseries that I wished was made in Hollywood! End of story!

As in the title says, this show is great
 Already people made detailed comments and I won't have anything futher to add
 But I'd like to point out two things
First one is complaints about predictability
 I strongly disagree that view
 Until the last second of the game, you'll be wondering who is going to be the winner
 Because the balance between characters is consistenly changing thanks to great storytelling and it makes you reconsider who deserves to win during the entire show
Second thing is apparently people annoyed by the performances of VIP actors
 It's true, VIP actors are really b type movie actors yet they have very short amount of screen time
 Therefore it doesn't affect the overall experience in my opinion
 If you're a person who has watched many other asian productions like me, it won't be a problem at all
 Whenever a British or American actor is being seen on Asian movies (both chinese and Korean), you'll find their performance laughable anyways
 Actors here reminds me IP Man 2
 Regardless this is not a serious issue to lean on
In short, don't miss it out and believe the hype
 Definitely deserves to watch

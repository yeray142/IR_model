An outstanding piece of Korean Television drama
 If you can see it with the subtitles and not the dubbed version, do so
 As others have said the dubbed version is atrocious
This literally is as I have described above
 A motley group of Koreans are given the chance to compete for a huge cash prize in a fierce competition where the soon find out to lose means death
Nearly 500 competitors are plucked from all walks of society to take part
 What do they all have in common? Poverty or huge debts or both
 The eclectic bunch of men and women complete some times against each other and some times in small teams on a string of games which soon sees their number dwindle to a few dozen
While we focus on a few key characters, some of whose lives have collided outside of the game, there's various subplots including one very improbable narrative about organ trafficking
 Where the show is strongest, is simply when it focuses on the games themselves and the moral dilemmas the characters have to face
 (One man is forced to kill his wife in one round, although several of my school mates would tell you that is a good thing)There are some stand out performances from the ensemble cast, inventive production design and excellent visuals
I don't want to say more for fear of spoilers
 Definitely worth your time

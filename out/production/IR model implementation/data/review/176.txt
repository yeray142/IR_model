Been an avid reader and viewer of several survival games, thriller and suspense series, this series is so predictable and draggy it really feels painful at some points
 A 1 minute dialogue can get dragged to a 10 minutes dialogue with simple shouting, gesturing and lots of unnecessary activity
Even though the premise is supposed to be on the real world, it is seriously not realistic
 Too much plot armor, plot holes, character personality inconsistencies, unexplained events and so on
 It's basically for people who like plot twists but do not think whether it is consistent or reasonable
 But one thing holds true, plot armor is stronger in this series than most of the ludicrous manga/ anime/ K-drama/ movie etc
 Etc
 Series I have seen
As I was browsing around, I found an article saying that the initial inspiration for Squid Game came from an unnamed comic book
 Ahh, now I see why
 It's basically a typical death survival game plot but heavily tweaked to reflect South Korean culture (unaccepting of foreigners, high household debt, the belief that women are inferior to men etc
And that is why the storyline is inconsistent, choppy, have plenty of plot holes and plot armor in a lot of sections
 Because the production crew does not let its characters tell a story, and there was much "micromanagement" in order to produce the desired results
It could have been much better, but it's really boring from Episode 6 because it suddenly became incredibly inconsistent, which also made it incredibly predictable
 This is where the "micromanagement" starts being especially prominent
Overall, it started out great, but went downhill quickly, especially from episode 6
Oh, and Squid Game is a clickbait title
 I guess the production crew wanted to draw interest to traditional South Korean games eh? Maybe this film is partly an introduction of South Korean childhood games and social culture to the world
 Even the North-South Korean dispute was touched upon, but more in the sense of the difficulties of the detractors
In summary, too much agenda, too little plot

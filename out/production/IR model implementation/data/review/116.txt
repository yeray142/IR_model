Let me preface: no, I am not a random person coming just to complain about something popular like the argument a lot of fans of this show make to defend it
 I have seen many horror/thrillers including the death game genre, so while I thought it had a mix of fun moments and boring ones, I can't wrap my head around the hype
 Many people bring up how it is similar to X game, book, movie, etc
 So I'm thinking Netflix created a way for casual and non-horror viewers to get exposure to it thinking it's new or innovating
Complaints about that aside, the first and sixth episodes are the best and the second is the worst by far with other ones somewhere between, so really the entire show was like a rollercoaster entertainment-wise for me
 It is watchable for sure, but certain characters (mainly the cop) are so moronic but protected by plot and could have been done away with or re-written
 Also annoying is, yes, the VIPs act horribly and, yes, everyone keeps ignoring the point of the game being there's only one winner
In summary, was it good? Depends on personal taste
 Was it genius, unique, or without flaws? Absolutely not
 I didn't enjoy it enough to binge, but it made for a decent casual viewing
 I'd suggest trying it yourself and forming your own opinions about it rather than listening to others about how amazing or terrible it may be

"You don't trust people because they are trustworthy
 You do it because you have nothing else to rely on"Squid Game is thoughtful, provocative, and darn productive in every sense
 Still, I would refrain from labeling it as some 'Masterpiece'
 Contrary to popular belief, it's not perfect
 Trust me, it has its fair share of flaws just like others do
 Yes, there are certain areas where it beats all our expectations, especially compare to all those series that had shared similar concepts before; yet, the deficiencies are a bit difficult to disregard whatsoever
If you ask me to recapitulate my impression in a single sentence, I would say; this is a well-acted, terrifically communicated (albeit outstretched) piece of work that would have no complications in attaining its unique set of audience (and judging by the current numbers, it already gathered enough)
I love how they upheld a certain amount of credibility and constancy in their dissertation throughout these nine episodes
 All the Social/Political innuendo makes it even more so worthy I reckon
 Even though I shouldn't be discussing all these in detail as I do not see myself sufficiently qualified to make an argumentative critique on the differences that are ever-present between Capitalist & Communist ideologies
 Instead, I'm leaning towards a more humane/psychological side of it
All these characters, personalities, come alongside their own set of guilts, motivations, purposes; a fascinating take on the human psyche, that is relatable on so many levels
 Thus, their persistence and misery convey absolute legitimacy
 And if you dare to take a closer look, the revelations might shock and terrify, as this is nothing but a reflective image of the society we all live in
From deliberately exposing the survivalist, ruthless instincts that are embedded deep in our subconscious since the beginning of our kind to showcasing this horrible world that is fraught with Greed, Expectations, and Disparities
 This series undoubtedly has tremendous depth in its underlying messaging, more than anybody could ever imagine
In the end, the show poses a stern challenge against the very foundation of humanity or should I say the moralities of it
 Furthermore, it begs the question; what it takes to be a human being? And are we even entitled to call ourselves one?

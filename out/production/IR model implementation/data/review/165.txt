A hype is a hype is a hype


 and our actual societys' Zeitgeist
 The series is far away from the mentioned "masterpiece"
 Its starts very good, the first 3 parts are very enjoyable, but then it goes down quite quickly
 Everything is far too obvious, from the beginning everything is so clear, not one single surprise to the end, and as a big fan of korean cinema i was disappointed by the poor storyline, the bad dialogues and the overacting
 Furthermore full of plotholes, another user already mentioned step by step the stupidities and logical mistakes
 All in all nothing special

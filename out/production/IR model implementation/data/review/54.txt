There's a lot of hype surrounding this series
 I thought it was okay, I almost didn't finish walking it after stopping halfway into episode 1
 The problem is that it gets into overly melodramatic family issues, and the protagonist is very unlikable
After fast forwarding to the subway station scene where he meets the guy who eventually gets him into the game, I stuck with the show
So the show is visually interesting
 I guess people get intrigued when they see photos of the sets
Unfortunately not all of the games are created equally, and not all of them are based on 'kids games' as we were led to believe (what kid game involves crossing a glass bridge? What kind of kid game involves cutting out a shape out of a cookie?!)
There were quite a few irritating characters
 Very stereotypical gangster type
 You'd think if the director was clever, he'd have the gangster character redeem himself near the end of his appearance, but no, he goes down still being a jerk
And he is brought down by an equally irritating character, the woman who is introduced as being someone who wanted to leave, but then later turns out to be just as ruthless as the gangster guy
The pakistani guy seems like someone who you can root for, but over time, he does get a bit irritating in his excessive naivety
 The old man is also irritating, and honestly, the twist at the end is dumb
 But I'll get back to that later
Over the course of the show, you only learn little bits of this place
 There are a few foreshadowings that give away twists a bit too easily
 You also learn this 'game' has apparently been happening for decades
 Strange, nobody seems to notice hundreds of people disappearing at the same time of year? And in all that time, none of the winners ever talked to anyone else about surviving the game?The series has pretty good energy until the last two or three episodes
 Then it just loses steam and gets dumb
 The introduction of the VIPs completely takes you out of the story
 It's so badly handled, you'd think you're watching another show
The final three scene is also inconsistent with the show
 Why are they given knives?! I thought the rules were they can't harm each other, because if two of the three were killed, there would be no final game for the VIPs to bet on
The final game is way too predictable, in that, you know it's coming
 And it doesn't even play out all that well
After a series of 30 minute episodes, the show ends with a super dull, 50 minute final episode that meanders
 You find out about the old man, but you never learn the reasons for the game, other than it's a rich person who is bored
 What's dumb is that the old man participated in these dangerous games, and could have died many times
 And when we hear him getting shot, how did he NOT get shot? The workers wouldn't know who he was
They never explain who the workers are and why they participate, and how they trust these people won't talk
 I guess they stay on the island all year? Or they all go back to their regular jobs
See, so many questions, so many holes
 The final ending is also pretty bad
 Not sure if they are setting it up for a sequel, or they just wanted a clever, open ending

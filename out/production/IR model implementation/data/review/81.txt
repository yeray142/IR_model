I only started watching because it pretty much blew up on the internet and it got me curious, and wow
 I really didn't expect much from this but I was proven wrong really quickly
 The basis of this show is something we're all familiar with: wealth inequality and the lines people are forced to and will cross for money, and it was the literal version of 'a rich man's playground'
 The poor were just things for him to play with, for some fun and excitement
 Anyway, the range of emotions I felt while watching the episodes was enough to leave me somewhat exhausted, but in a good way
 Really, I gotta hand it to the team that worked on this because it was clearly a high budget and high quality production
 Also, I know it's pretty rare for Korean shows to have more than 1 season, but that ending was hinting at a 2nd season, wasn't it?

The was a fun, fascinating show that was more emotional than I ever expected it to be but also not as violent as I was expecting either
 There is some brutal violence but extremely tolerable unless you are squeamish
Many of the characters you will feel a connection to even if they aren't in the main cast
 There are some you will enjoy getting their "come up'ins" to a satisfying end
 The choices the lead characters make will enrage you and make you despise them but the backstory given to those characters will also make you understand why they do/did the things they do/did
There isn't much in the way of surprises (except the hair, if you've finished you know what I mean) but there are some decent plot twists that may catch you off guard
 The 6 games themselves, many across the world will know or may have even done; some you'll be like "really?"
 All are brutal by design
 This is worth the watch and dubbing in English didn't look or sound as bad as it could have

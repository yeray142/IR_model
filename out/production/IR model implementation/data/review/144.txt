The sereal started very interesting
 You dont know why happening this, who is behind this, and what kind of child game thay will play
 But after episode 7 when the vip-s arrived, the whole concept are turnd up side down
 All the serial become predictible, like im feeling my self as a precog
 Who is the vip-s, who is the firshand whatever
 That makes from 8 star to 7
 But is still a good seral
 A new type of battle royale
 But the most annoying thing is, the concept was the child games, and that is gone when the vip-s was arrived
 Why this concept changed? That was the moment when i changed my mind ftom 7 to 6 star
 And of course the vip-s are super lame, but the concept change are way more worst than bad acting

I have been very greatly entertained by this series
 I would have given it a 10 but I took a point off because of the poor acting from the VIP's and the ending that seemed rushed
 I could have thought of a better suited and deserving ending instead of a destructive one
 I also did not understand the drastic change of hair color in the end
 The subtitles can also be improved
 Accurate translations including the slangs can change the effect of any foreign film
All in all, this series is fantastic! It has interesting twists and surprises
 It is violent so I definitely do not recommend for kids to watch even though it has kids games in it
 The story reminded me of The Hunger Games but also unique in its own way
 I would classify this as Horror/Drama/Thriller genre
 The character development is very well written where a lot of movies fail to succeed
 It is very important to any movie
 Episode 7 for me is quite emotional and also 9
 You have to be cold hearted not to fight back the emotions of what this episode brings
 All the main characters did a great job
 I like the mixture of different types of people
 Definitely recommend

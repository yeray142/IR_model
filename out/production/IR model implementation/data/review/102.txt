I am an ardent follower of the Korean movies
 Even though most of the movies are laden with violence, gore and bloodbath, the chills and thrills of most of the movies I have watched till date have not disappointed me
 But I was a bit apprehensive of watching a Korean web-series even though it is insanely popular and one of the most trending shows in the recent past
 The very name Squid Game , the latest offering from Netflix did not appear to be very much appealing
 However, I risked my time on the rave reviews the show is getting
 And boy! It has paid back
 I cannot recall any single show more edge of the seat than this
 Yes, there may be better shows in terms of intrinsic production values
 But if you ask me to select one show where even for one second, I could not hold my breath, it was this, it was this, nothing but this
 Normally my hectic work schedule does not allow me to binge-watch a show
 But Squid Game eventually turned me to a Binge-watcher
 It is so much enjoyable, spine chilling and mind bending
It is believed that even if ghosts exist, the human beings are capable of making this world even a more ghostly place than the original ghosts would do
 Basically, greed, lust, lack of control, survival instinct, desire for power and authority, insanity make people do macabre things and when people get the taste of blood, they become even more dangerous than the man-eating animals
 Squid Game captivates human emotions to an extent you are awestruck
 The level where people can stoop to, to make things shinier for his own life will make you sick as you watch episodes after episodes of this brilliantly made series
 The raw violence and gore trademarks of the Korean style of moviemaking is present throughout and this makes the show unsuitable for the children even though the central theme is based on the games played during childhood
 In the age of Super Computers, when people have stopped playing those forgotten games any longer, a group of losers are seduced to play six rounds of those games
 Winning will guarantee them freedom from every debt as the rewards of winning are astronomical
 But the punishment for losing is what makes the series so very horrific, gruesome and rewarding- death
 How the real-life losers vie with each other to redeem their own lost hopes is the plot of this super paced series
The show is full of metaphors
 It may be worth mentioning that of late numerous movies have also come up with the portrayal of the absence of an egalitarian society in South Korea
 The rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer
 Remember Parasite and the subtle show of class struggle therein? Squid Game also tends to point fingers to the inequality prevailing in the South Korean society
 Few references to the illegal immigration from North Korea are there, too
Squid Game in may ways is similar to one movie I watched long back- Exam
 There also the creator worked on the same concept and I liked that movie
 But in Squid Game, the dividends are more rewarding, scintillating and thrilling
 I simply cannot recall a single dull moment in the entire show with a runtime of around eight and half hours
 The lead actors especially Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae Soo, Jung Ho-yeon are stunning
 The old man (I could not google his name) was fascinating
 The script is tight, gripping and addictive
 The cinematography is insanely horrific just what the screenplay demanded
 The music matches with the spirit of the show
 The creator Hwang Dong-hyuk creates an environment that is claustrophobic, ominous and jaw dropping
Overall, this show will haunt you days after you have finished watching it
 Remember, it is not an easy watch because of the abundance blood spill
 But if you are a lover of the thriller/horror genre, this is a series you have been waiting for years
 This is going to make amends for the poor choices Netflix has been making for sometime now
 Be a player, watch Squid Game

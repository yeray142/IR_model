This is a simple formula that has been done to death "poor people being made to do highly fatal games while rich people watch"
 By now people should be over this kind of thing, but it makes them feel smart, and they can parrot phrases they heard from other people like "it's an study of human nature" etc etc
 The positives for it are the aesthetic of the sets and costumes
 This world and it's environment just make you want to jump into the screen and explore, though not if it means being a part of the games
 I enjoyed it well enough but let's face it, this is no 8
0+ IMDB ratings are a joke

A pretty gripping show that has 7 solid episodes
Sadly it has one filler episode and falls apart a bit at the end, but for the most part it's a season that you can't stop watching
Definitely worth a watch and am recommending to my friends
Don't think it needs a second season but I imagine one will be made

Absolutely fabulous! Truly fabulous
 I was terribly bummed to read so many reviews that claim the subtitle translation was bad; as an English-only speaker, proper translations are paramount
 I never watch English language dubs as they are horrible compared to watching (and hearing real characters voicing their parts) in the original language with the subtitles on
In all honesty, this likely would have been a '10' had it not been for some slow areas in episodes 1, 2, & 9
 That's not to say that they were bad, but there is a necessity for backstory that is handled in these episodes (or post-story, re: ep9) and to me there were some wasted opportunities
 Nonetheless, the show is definitely binge worthy
 I went through it in two days and am hopeful they'll do another season
Extremely well produced, a super cool mix of fantasy, action, and drama with a novel story line
 But hey


what's up with Lee Byung-hun not being credited in IMDB for his cameo as The Frontman? I get that the "walking around" character didn't need to be Byung-hun, but it was such a surprise to see his face behind the mask that he needs to be credited

Nothing more than a Korean version of hunger game with some cheap metaphors to criticize capitalism, democracy, ethics etc
 Terrible acting, cliche dialogues and predictable scenes that drag for minutes and minutes
Probably enjoyable for a disturbed teenager boy, Anyone else with any common sense will find a completely waste of time

I was engrossed! Very interesting story and characters UNTIL the last episode
 I just could have done without the boo hoo blah blah sentimental "here is why" explanation
 I believe that was obvious
 The most worthy of friendships in the game was ruined for me in the last episode
It's worth a go
 It teaches age old lessons again but it's always worth learning them, again

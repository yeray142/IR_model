Well multiple games actually, but even that you may find 


 not accurate
 Now you may not look the same way at some games that are being played here
 But with all the buzz right now, you've probably heard quite a bit about that already
If like you got into this without any spoilers (congrats by the way), then the show will be able to surprise quite a few times
 Be it by the players themselves but also and even more so by how the story evolves
 It may not end exactly how I would imagine 


 but that can also be seen as a good thing I reckon
As a fan of Korean cinema I was curious about this anyway
 And it did not dissapoint - at all
 The acting is amazing, the effects are great 


 and the story is as mature as it can get
 With enough social commentary and critique to make this a great watch!

The plot is exciting

 keeps the viewers on the edge of their seat

 but the ending is so rushed and not so great

 the final game chosen, the squid game is not so exciting especially for only 2 players 

 then to make it worse it turned into a boring cliched knife fighting scene

 they should have chosen a more exciting game for a great climax

in the earlier part it's kinda weird that sang woo showed his caring side to Gi Hun in the first game but then suddenly in the second game he showed his selfishness just after he agreed to team up with him

 I get it sang woo is being competitive to win the money but it does not seem he looks at Gi hun as a threat and there are still many other opponents at that time

so why showed Sang woo's good side just to expose his selfishness so soon?And in the end I get it when sang woo suddenly has his conscience and finally let Gi Hun wins, because he knows Gi Hun is a nice guy that will make sure his mother will get somethingbut it is kinda boring that Gi Hun is being too nice and too kindhearted and wants to end everything at the edge of winning just to let that selfish sang woo lives


not after what sang woo did to everyone

 It will be more satisfying if Gi Hun just wins the game fair and square and just let sang woo be killed by that masked staffand at the end it is so irrational to use the sad emotional music while the mastermind is explaining why he did all that

 so are we suppose to feel sorry for him and forget how evil he truly is?And how does Gi Hun save himself from all the loan sharks for one whole year? He didnt use his money so there is no way he settled his debt with them

And I dont like it that Gi Hun left his plane in the end I mean for what? Yes he has won the game once but there is no way he can get his revenge he is no match for them

dont tell me after he is being depressed for one whole year than suddenly he will be heroic and all smart in the second season? (If there is any) Unless Jun Ho, the policeman is actually not dead maybe they can team up with Gi Hun's money and all the information that Jun Ho got, they might get somewhereand if it is really the end of Jun Ho, it is so bad to write him off just like that, not after he took so many risks to gather all the proves but to no use

The acting of most characters, the cinematography and the idea are nice, only I just wish it has a better ending

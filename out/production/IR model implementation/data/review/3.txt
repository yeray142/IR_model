I went into this show knowing absolutely nothing about it other than being a korean series
 And yet i found it annoyingly predictable with almost nothing surprising me
 Maybe i've just seen too many movies, but i've seen this all before
 And i think what a lot of ppl like about this show is the norm in korean cinema
 But most casuals have never watched a korean movie (if so, you're missing out, only thing that comes close to hollywood-level quality)i mentioned it in my title, but if you loved this series and are shocked by my low rating, please please please watch oldboy (not the american remake)
 It's superior in every way imaginable and an amazing movieoverall, this was an okay show
 I was really into it at first, but it seemed to decline after the halfway point
 By the end, i was feeling minimal impact from the big moments, and during the last episode i just wanted it to finish
 There's a lot of good here, but many negatives as well
 See below
Things that bothered me (without spoilers)-a scene that could have been really cool but they full-on strobe lighted it so you couldn't see anything-a ridiculously annoying female character (the older one), biggest offense is the eye-rolling bathroom scene-some really questionable decisions, some to the point of angering me-characters asking moronic questions or being outraged at things that they can't possibly still be outraged aboutthe games start out creative with skill, talent and strategy involved, but become random and filled with luck-the laughable acting and dialogue for all of the english scenes
 This is the norm for asian cinema, but that doesn't mean it can always be forgiven
 It was AWFUL
 Can't they hire any experienced american actor? Or an english dialogue correspondent?-i like when a movie is the right kind of weird, the kind that makes it feel unique and adds character
 But a lot of the weird in this show seemed to be there solely for the sake of being weird
-there were SO many times where i knew exactly what was going to happen next

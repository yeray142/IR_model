Regardless of the plot, subject matter, etc, this was overall some of thee best acting I've ever seen
 Keep in mind I'm disregarding the VIPs lol
 But this movie is making me feel things I absolutely did not expect at all going into this, lol
 I feel "truth" from almost every main cast member
 Honestly, it's a brilliant performance and, if it were a movie and shot to be a movie, I'd see it making waves in American mainstream similar to Train to Busan
 A+++ to the actors, wow, the character arcs in this are awesome to watch

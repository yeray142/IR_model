So Squid Game has taken over the world these last few weeks and I thought that I had to watch it and I have now finished it and here is my review for it
 The premise of the show sees a large group of down on there luck Koreans assembled to play childhood games with a deadly twist for a huge cash prize
Main Character
Lee Jung-Jae plays the lead character Gi-Han on the show and he is fantastic
 At first he seems like this arrogant lowlife, but as you get to know him you see that he has just been really unfortunate and made some poor decisions
 As he faces the games his character really starts to grow and he becomes an interesting protagonist and one you can support
Supporting Characters
There is a huge cast of people in this show and everybody acts there role really well
 Oh Yeong-su really stands out as an old man involved with the game and the relationship between him and Lee Jung-Jae is superb and I really grew to care about this dynamic and for me they were the best characters on the show
 There are so many other amazing characters that I think you just need to watch the show and experience them for yourself and the great writing that is done for each person
Story
The story is fascinating, seeing these different personalities forced into these games causes natural conflict and tension
 The different games are really great in there own unique ways and do a really brilliant job of pacing them out really well
 The only issue I had was a big twist that happens towards the end of the show, it just didn't work for me and I think it could have been handled better
 Also there are these English speaking VIP's and they are really bad and took me out of the show for sure
Script
The script is fantastic, and that is if you watch it in Korean with subtitles
 For the love of everything holy don't watch it with English dubbing, it is bad and it is nowhere near as effective and feels unnatural for the performances
 There is some nice humour and the drama is ramped up ten fold, the chemistry between the performers is really good and drives you to keep watching
Style
The show is really brutal, the violence is graphic but feels appropriate for the show as a whole
 It is shot beautifully and feels epic in scale
 The pacing is effective and you will want to binge this show for sure with each episode feeling different and great in there own way
Overall
Overall, Squid Game is a truly fantastic show that was so close to getting my 10/10 score
 It is a must watch and don't let the language barrier turn you off and get started with it as soon as possible

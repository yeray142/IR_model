There's a lot of blood and violence in my opinion
 I often wonder which is the more accurate one
 Does blood gush out if a bullet pierces a person and how much
 Is it like tiny not visible droplets that couldn't be caught on camera and then there's blood pouring from the wound I doubt it's a splatter fest
The social commentary was elsewhere too but I found the voting scene most fascinating
 How half of the players wanted to get the money and risk their life
 I get that many of the players were desperate but can't these people get even a litt paying job rather than play in the squid game
 I'll rather work at a McDonald's than risk my life

I think if I spoke Korean and could watch this without it being dubbed, I would probably love it and give it at least 9 starts
 But the dubbing is bad and the dialogue is amateurish
 I'm guessing they have to make the English words fit the time frame of the actor's mouths moving and maybe because of that it is not a direct translation and that is why it is often so bad
 But beyond that, the voice actors doing the dubbing are often pretty flat in their delivery
 So while this is an intriguing watch, it is marred by the voice actors doing the dubbing (and the writers who I think could have done better with the dialogue)

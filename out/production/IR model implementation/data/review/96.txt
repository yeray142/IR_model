The show has an interesting storyline - you can draw various metaphors (about society, capitalism) if you want to, or simply watch something with a different concept
 The writing does enough to make you care about the characters
The acting was brilliant overall! Camera work, color correction/editing & set design were AMAZING and the music was great
All that said, I don't think it's mind blowing
 Parts of the show that others LOUVE you may just like or you won't mind
 Don't let that get in the way of your decision to watch the show or not
 I think you should not miss out on it
 The show is also brutal, dark and might be disturbing but still very entertaining

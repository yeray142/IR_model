I fail to see what got people so hyped about this
 It is slow, veeeeryyy predictable, characters not relatable at all, long winded bathetic (yes that is a word) scenes, borderline annoying characters, no skill or smarts needed only luck, very poorly written "twists" that fail to be twists and so on


 This is a huuuggeee disappointment

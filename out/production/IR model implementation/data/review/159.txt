Do you still believe humans are good?SG had me yelling at the screen like I was back at Chestnut Street in Philly
It wasn't necessarily that all the players are horror-movie-stupid, but rather, many didn't catch on quickly enough to how ruthless the game was becoming
 I tried to plead with them: Open your eyes! Wake up! Dig up your inner skeptic!!! Work on the world "NO!" Augh!Hwang Dong-hyuk, the author stated his purpose: "I wanted to write a story that was an allegory or fable about modern capitalist society, something that depicts an extreme competition, somewhat like the extreme competition of life
" He was building on his own experience of financial hardship
SG is another foray into the callus debauchery of which humans are capable
 SG builds on 'The Most Dangerous Game' with a twist
 Here, bored wealthy men devise a game in which they entice poor souls who are in financial straits to come play
 What the people aren't told is that it's a game to the death, and out of 456 players, only one will remain alive at the end
 Instead of the wealthy participating in the hunt, they prefer to watch the "horses" perform


 And die
K-dramas excel at extracting every possible wince and gasp out of the viewer
 The horror, the absolute sickness of using the happy color pink, along with other nursery colors, and the giant doll, is all nauseating
 It multiplies the dread
The story of the cop, Hwang Jin-ho, is heartbreaking
 He only went there to save his brother, and his brother ended up killing him
 His brother had been seduced by the power of the dark side
 Lee Byung-hun, who played the front man & cop's brother, expertly displayed suppressed grief, & overt resolve to continue forward
 After all, it's his brother, or him, right?Every performing "horse" has a number
 Numerology sites offer mostly identical interpretations
 This is not meant to be an endorsement, it is to decode what the writer is telling us
 Definitions in Numerology tend to be general, which broadens the applications
 Having said that, Let's see if any of the numbers have any special significance


>456 is slacker-protagonist Seong Gi-hun, and signifies effort and patience
 A mentor is needed who will teach how to learn to work harder on oneself before other things
 Hard work will add value to life
 456 picked up a gganbu mentor in 001
 Who says the mentor has to be a good person?>218 is for Cho Sang-woo, 456's friend from the 'hood,' who became a whilte collar hood as an adult
 He mirrors the old man to a point
 He failed in his ruthless journey to gain wealth, but found redemption in his last moments
The number 218 symbolizes manifesting one's biggest and seemingly impossible desires into reality, often related to: wealth, business, duality, realism, karma, & serving humanity
 He knows that 456 will serve his mother, as well as humanity with the money
 This loathsome human craved redemption at the end of his life, and he received it
>067 is for Kang Sae-byeok, the North Korean defector, who wants to protect her family
 No surprise, 067 signifies home, family, unconditional love, providing, responsibility, sacrifice, & service to others
 Creating a solid foundation for the future, and protecting their families & possessions is the priority of 067's
>001, the old man's # is at its most positive when in the realm of work
 It is a number given to winners to indicate the first place
 This number represents independence, but this can also mean loneliness, isolation, or being single
>101 is gangster, Jang Deok-su's number
 It's primary function is romance, followed by the importance of relationships
 At first blush this doesn't fit with the character, though he did get involved in a quasi romantic relationship
 Let's flesh this out further
It's basic function is coexistence
 Without it, a 101 is alone, which doesn't exist in the 101 essence
 People with that number can feel lonely and lost whenever they think of themselves as being alone
 #101 must have grown up in an environment that failed to provide his basic needs, leaving him consumed with bitterness
The number also points to eternity & the journey, with all its uncertainties, that is about to begin
 101 is a reminder that we are not in control of our destiny but that God is in control
 101's should follow the path set and learn all possible before the time on this plane is completed
 It's sad to think that 101 obviously didn't get emotional support or the tools to succeed in life
 He is still responsible for his infractions, but it's sad, nevertheless
>199 is Abdul Ali, one of the worst heartbreaks of the show
 199's are independent & comfortable pursuing their agenda, which, for Ali is providing for his family on his own
 #199's goals virtually never conflict with long-term human survival and well-being
 We see that Ali is good, and decent, albeit naive
 He's also foolish to be so independent that he wagered his life in that way to provide for his family
>212 is for Han Mi-nyeo, the crazy acting women who killed #101
#212 is for a person who frequently follows newly-acquired interests, perhaps on a whim - meeting new people, and visiting unfamiliar places
 212 is about curiosity & adventure & tends to be a good team member
 The energy can be sensual
 A caution is to not to go overboard with actions they may lead to negative outcomes
 Enroute towards goals, 212's might face harsh challenges
An additional connection to 101 is that only the negative interpretations are exhibited by them
 Their harsh lives had severed them from the positive elements olin themselves
 They portray ruthlessness, but there is a sadness, or a sense of loss about them too
>111 is the doctor
 A 111 won't let himself be slotted into a team member role, unless the role is real leadership, not a role where he's told how to lead
 If 111's thoughts are negative, it could be attract toxic situations and people into life
>240 is Ji-yeong, who was just released from prison after killing her abusive father
 She sacrificed her life for 067, as thus negated the lie the VIP's tell themselves
 She had already sacrificed her freedom to administer justice for her mother
#240 is about nurture & mutual support with a high focus on security for the future, provided without prompting or expectation of return
>244, the pastor: Spiritual advancement is something that can be phenomenal in a 244's life
 He must keep wrong at bay and not offend the inner energy that his maker installed
 Do not lose hope that belief will provide the reasons to continue
>the husband/wife duo is represented in 69, or two identical digits facing and complimenting each other to make a whole
 If we squeeze 6&9 together we could make an 8, or the eternity sign
 In addition, the visual aspect of the # is sometimes seen as a symbol of yin and yang
The energy of 69 is best when involved directly with family or team as an equal, provided 69's vision or ideal is present or promising
Freakily, #069 symbolizes the closure of a chapter in life & encourages one to be prepared for a rather traumatic phase
 Whether the ending is good or bad, it is bound to bring a huge change in life
 Be prepared for it because the the manner in which it's dealt with is going to effect the rest of one's life
Upon their return, in EP3, 187 players return
 It's the US police code for murder
Getting chills?Contrast to these poor rich people
 Their lives are so empteeeeee
 Sigh
Up to 21% off CEO's are psychopaths
 It's not a stretch to guess that some of these rich degenerates are in that club
 They also exhibit heightened sadism
 These reprobates can't seem to notice through all the haze of life, that people are most gratified when we help others
001 didn't get what he wanted by hosting Squid Game, which was friendship through comraderie as well as a cure for boredom
 It seems he and the VIP's justified their actions by deluding themselves that they were conducting a social experiment- The fact that they pit people against each other, and reassure themselves that everyone is as cutthroat as them, allowed them to inveigle their own selves that those people deserve to die: Look at who they really are! In the end, the old man had the whole world, but was utterly unsatisfied
The old man craved the friendship he'd had when he was poor
 He felt that kinship with 456, even though 456 eventually betrayed him
 (At the time, 456 had a second chance, too
 He could have done the all-or-nothing but refused
 That was his worst moment)
 What 001 had seen, over the many years, allowed him to forgive 456 due to the kindness 456 had shown overall
 He meant it when he called 456 his gganbu, or close buddy
This kinship manifests itself in that the old man wanted to see HIM at the end of his life
 456 is there at his bedside when he died
 Where's his wife? Where's his kids?? Where's his grandkids??? Just 456 and a paid aid were there
 The old man saved 456's 'life' a second time, by jolting him back to living
456 is who he is
 Even when he wins he's a pathetic winner that barely stumbles across the line
 He won, but he didn't get what he wanted
 When he went to see the old man in the penthouse, he won their game, but he didn't get what he wanted: The old man died before 456 could kill him
 However, it did wake 456 up
 He no longer had to feel guilty about tricking & almost killing the old man
 He now feels badly about not completing the task
The red hair indicates that he's now either on fire or starting to blaze his trail
 Finally
This is not over
 We need a season 2

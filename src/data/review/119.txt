Just completed the series and found this show so thought provoking for many reasons
 You have your standard character developmental checklist which is desperation, greed, boredom, curiosity, evilness and pure disregard that builds a cast of characters
 The premise of the show is simple on the surface, but it much more complex the deeper you get into it
This show also brings a disturbing realization to me in real life:
I mentioned the show to my daughter who is in her first year of teaching kindergarten
 She said 3/4 of her students are watching the show! That shocks me but it also explains why the children today in public school are malcontents
 What I hear from my daughter, wife (who is also a teacher) and many other teachers is school is more of place to dump misfit children that gets absolutely no life lessons from their parents
 The fact that 3/4 of her students know and watch Squid Game tells me everything I need to know where our society is going
 It's not pretty, and Squid Game has a very strong potential of becoming reality
 3/4 of our little darlings are going to find themselves in debt, in trouble, in a desperate need that they would step on their mother's throat to get out of
 What a warm and fuzzy thought!

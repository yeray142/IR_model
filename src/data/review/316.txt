Even though there are many gameshows that require contestants to survive for one reason or another, Squid Game stands out thanks to its breathtaking visuals and superbly written characters
 The former is done through colorful scenery that perfectly fits the "kids games" theme as well as the organized nature of a secretive organization's facility that houses so many people
 As for the latter, EVERY character is struggling to make ends meet but how they put themselves in that position is extremely unique
 The group is diverse with the main guy having to pay a debt he owes to land sharks, his friend having embezzled money from his business, an old man who is living out his remaining time with a brain tumor, a gangster who stole money from his boss, a woman who got scammed and more
 Add to that the dark humor, an unraveling mystery surrounding the game show, and violence and you have the recipe for an addictively bingeable show

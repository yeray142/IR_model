Animal World is in my top 10 all-time favorite movies, largely because it was truly an ORIGINAL plot & was so well executed! I love it for it's ORIGINALITY
 The further along this series gets, the more I'm starting to enjoy it, but also it's becoming an IRREFUTABLE doppelganger of "Animal World!" From the debt, the transportation of the contestants, the Mom who's going into the hospital for serious health issues and he can't pay for it, the main character blowing his money on betting & being a child-like burden on his elderly Mom, signing away his Mom's house, the friend who betrayed him (when he knew what the candy-cutting game was) even knowing his friend will likely die and he had multiple opportunities to clue him in, the fact that they're way out on an island (cruise ship) where no one would expect them to be & couldn't find them, even to the organ harvesting! On AW, some losers were also used for live human experimentation! I'm pretty sure I've had the plot-twist figured out for the last few episodes, so they've hooked me enough to keep watching until I know if I'm right or wrong
 It's a GREAT idea for a movie/show, so I can understand why someone would want to do something SIMILAR, but do it CREATIVELY DIFFERENT! Especially with a 9 episode show, you have the opportunity & air time to take the idea and run with it! Don't use a movie like a precise blueprint, that's just plagiarism! So, because i love the premise so much, I'm hooked and have to see it to the end, even if it irritates me!

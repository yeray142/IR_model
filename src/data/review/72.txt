Squid Game is a South Korean series on Netflix that blew up recently and got on my radar
 Didn't watch any trailers or read any reviews, all I knew was that it was about some "Game" and thought it might be like those Japanese game shows or maybe kinda like Wipeout but with a story
 That didn't exactly turn out to be the case and I was hooked quickly during the first episode
 The series is about a bunch of people knee-deep in troubles joining a game where they compete for a massive cash prize where the penalty for failure is extreme
Boasting multiple characters that you get to know over the course of the season, all backed up by wonderful performances from the cast, getting invested in the story comes easy
 They are a varied bunch and the way the series is directed and paced, you pretty much feel as if you're going through this ordeal alongside them
 The psychological manipulation that the organization has set up for them and trying to see what you would have done in the situation only adds to the entertainment
I loved how the creator of the series took mostly common games that a lot of us probably have played sometimes in our childhoods and turned them macabre
 With good direction and well-paced flow, the tension was often racked up to a great degree and the more you get attached to certain characters, the more intense it got, sometimes being outright brutal and gut-wrenching (I'm looking at you Episode 6)
 The games never got boring nor did they get repetitive as there would mostly be some twists and turns added into the mix
It also doesn't hurt the experience that this feels like a big production and not what you'd expect from a "Game" series
 Apart from a few shoddy CGI shots which can easily be dismissed, most of it looked and sounded great
However, the series does falter a bit in the second half where, for spoilers sake, let's just say some things get revealed and they are what you'd boringly expect and probably have predicted early on
 On top of that, the performances in that chunk, especially relative to the performances from the rest of the cast, just weren't good
 Would have wished they kept things in the dark more, keep the air of mystery or have a bit more meat
 Good thing it doesn't ruin the series nor does it impact the overall story a great deal which does end on a high note with social commentary and messaging that one can enjoy
Overall, props to Hwang Dong-hyuk, the Writer and Director, who after a long journey of being rejected by so many areas finally got to make his series and it's heartwarming to see it get so popular and receive praise and his hard work pay off immensely, so Never Give Up I guess
 Unless you're squeamish and can't handle rough stuff, I'd highly recommend this series to everyone, but chances are you have already seen it
 Had a great time with it
 Wherever they decide to take the story next, I'll certainly am looking forward to it
 And if I were to rate it, I'd give it an 8
5/10

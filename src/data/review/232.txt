I saw this drama cause I am a Kdrama lover 
But it was not for me
 From the first till the last episode was reproduced violence in every way
 Sexual, verbal ,physical, just plain, coarse ,cruel and bloody-minded violence
 Absolutely not reccomended to everyone under the age of 18
Regarding the plot , there was some parts with no reason
 For example the whole story about the policeman was just unnecessary as he was not involved with the main characters
In my opinion only the last episode tried to "save" the whole disturbing face of the drama showing a more human side , and giving the moral message that money don't bring happiness

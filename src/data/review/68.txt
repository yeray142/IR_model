I heard so much hype for this so I was excited to watch
 I did enjoy the first episodes a lot and was really positively surprised with diverse characters like Ali and Sae Byeok
 I wish we got more depth to her and surely she would have had very interesting background/flashbacks
 I wish there had been more winners honestly, cos i thought multiple winners were possible
 The whole VIP rich guys pay to watch people die seemed quite predictable too
 I never really found Gi-hun that relatable and wasnt much character growth
 I really think Sae Byeok shouldnt have died - but survived and won the game for her brother and family
 It was nice touch Gi-hun did keep his promise and gave her brother better life, but still
 The end of him going back to the game is promising for S2, but cliche

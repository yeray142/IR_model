This show shows us the hypocrite nature of humans and how they can turn into monsters when the things come to money & self life
But at some instances the plot was predictable like in E2 (voting stops at 100-100 and the last man will decide the result), the front man turns to be the police officers brother and the last episode ended at such an anti-climatic note (sang woo kills himself for what? After returning from game Gi hun forgets about his daughter for whom he wants to be a good father)

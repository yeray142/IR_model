Incredibly captivating series that will have you on the edge of your seat, continually wondering what will happen next
I was sceptical after seeing the trailer but thought I'd give it a go anyways and I'm glad I did, it definitely does not disappoint
The story is well-crafted and thought-out and is a rollercoaster of emotion, it contains some beautifully heart-wrenching moments
 The cinematography is great and can be very clever at times, the acting and direction is on point too
Definitely recommend, if you like a horror/thriller Squid Game is a series that will have you hooked right from the off

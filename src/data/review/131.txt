After "Liar Game" and "Alice in Borderland" we have "Squid game"
Some parts have been gruesome and to much fo me but thank God it's on Netflix and I could skip :)
Marbles game was so emotional that I have cried a little and I'm not ashamed to admit it
Very happy to have binge watch it
PS
 Gong Yoo from "Train to Busan" or Goblin has also a short appearance among many other known actors from K-dramas

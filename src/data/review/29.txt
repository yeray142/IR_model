Squid game is a great TV show and talk about a big problem in society and this is about money
 The TV show talk about this theme trough all the episodes and how far will go someone without money and how far will go someone with money
 I enjoyed the TV show: it have some great moments and heartbreaking sometimes
 Some mysteries also and some big revelations
 I enjoyed also the end who have more a psychological point and a different perspective of why they did all the stuff arround the squid game and i found it pretty believable and great to watch
 I will recommend anyone to watch this TV Show
 It was quite good

It becomes one of successfully Korean dramas
 Besides the brutal element, the setting of each game involves lot of tactics, eg composition of the team, your partner, sequence etc

 which determine your success rate
 There is nothing relevant to distasteful Saw game! Plus all of them participate in the game on a voluntary basis!Another thing I like most is about character development
 All main characters' acting are excellent, and the supporting roles like snake tattoo, Pakistan contestants are also competent
 It reminds me of Busanhaeng! However, these foreigners VIP acting are so embarrassing
Just a bit strange
 Gi-Hoon personality setting difference before and after participating in the game is too much
 In the past, he was kind of greedy gambler
 However he suddenly ends up like a superhero with full of truth and justice
 If you don't want to use the money, it's better to donate it
 So comparatively Sang-Woo character is more consistent
 All in all, I did enjoy it from the beginning till the end

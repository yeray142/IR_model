"Squid Game" is one of the best Netflix shows to come out in a long time
 It's a truly twisted yet inventive show filled with amazing performances and terrifying situations
This show truly kept me engaged throughout all its 9 episodes
 The characters are absolutely amazing
 Each character is truly fleshed out in their own ways making you care about some yet hate others
 The acting is amazing
 Each actor gives a commented, realistic, and terrified performance, and it feels real
 The games too are very fun to watch
 Some are quick and fast, while others are slow and terrifying
 It's a very inventive premise for a show
 Also the show truly made me cry
 It's a show that succeeds at making you love characters too much
 And that will result in you crying at certain things that happen in the show
 The show also just has a real look at what it's like living in debt
 It's makes you think whether it's worth it to risk your life to get money
I have but ONE little issue with the show
 The first 2 episodes are just a little slow
 I feel that they could've been better paced, but that's it
"Squid Game" is a truly amazing show that has amazing performances, fleshed out characters, a real look at reality, and a premise that's so creative that it's almost impossible to enjoy

Watched the whole thing in a day after hearing bout it from others and some guy going its way way way out there the games like I would never have seen before!? SO NOT TRUE the plot story even plant was all Very predictable and we've seen these escape death tournaments a hundred times before usually in a just movie length and with bigger faster action so really this should just be youre average 5 but I gave a extra point as the actors are good 
 And it does do as a good enough past time
 Its just not something that needed to be a series

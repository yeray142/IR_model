I get the premise

 I get the idea

 I just don't get the acting
 You have characters acting super goofy at times and then super serious at other times

 like, not on a real world scale but a comical scale

 it's like watching Jim Carrey switch from Ace Ventura to Keanu Reeves' John Wick (in the beginning of the first one)

 how are you gonna have a goofy nerd making absurd faces and dancing around like and idiot some badass later on? It makes no sense

 certainly have never witnessed this in any human behavior I've ever seen
 It's like they wrote the part for 4 very different people and then combined it into one

 I give it points for originality but I hated the characters
 They all could have died and it would have probably turned out better

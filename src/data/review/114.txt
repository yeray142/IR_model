*light spoilers of plot details*So, Squid Game is a story about a large group of deeply indebted Korean citizens who willingly take part in a deadly game in the hopes of taking away a massive cash prize, at the expense of the other participants' lives
Now, that's all well and good
 Who doesn't love a good show of violence and human selfishness? However, this story paints the loves of the participants in a way that is often boring, uninteresting, and downright unbelievable
 Honestly, none of the characters act like real people, and there are several GLARING plot holes and nonsensical plot points to boot; for example, 456 people go missing at the exact same time, staying missing for three days, 255 of them NEVER RETURNED, and absolutely nobody, anywhere, seems to notice what should be an international headline (except for one detective who decides to investigate it off the books, who conveniently informs noone of his investigation or wherabouts
As well, I couldn't write about this show without discussing the insane premise that it relies upon: that all of our main characters decided to take part in a game that would kill all but one of them, and all participants are made aware of this fact, and despite that meaning that they and the people they met during the first game have virtually no chance of survival
 And yet, all of them act as if it isn't the case
 Only 3% of the people who were unknowingly thrust into a lethal game and witnessed 225 people killed before their very eyes decided that their problems weren't bad enough to warrant throwing their lives away in a game that only one person could survive
 Bulls**t
 Everyone with a family and loved ones, everybody who voted to end the games after the first session of bloody horror, all of them determined that they in fact had no reason to live or were going to die anyway, and that the only way normal life would be feasible is if they give the murder games another shot
 Who cares about the odds, amiright? Furthermore, our beloved main characters, all stupid enough to enter this lethal lottery, continue to develop friendships between and during each murder game, forever in denial of the fact that they will die
 I don't understand how any of these people, excluding the actual psychopaths, can rationalize reentering the game
 Sure, maybe they didn't even consider the odds, maybe all of these degenerate gamblers are so stupid and so arrogant that they all believe they will be the sole victor; but, that hardly explains why a married couple entered the games, knowing for a fact that AT LEAST one of them would die
There are too many impossibly irrational character choices in this show to list, and far too many for a critical viewer like myself to ignore
 Without reasonable people or a remotely well thought-out story, it's damn near impossible to suspend my disbelief
 I watched it anyway, just to see how much further down the plot hole-hole they could go
 By the way, the last episode is damn near impossible to sit through and features two very different yet equally flacid plot twists
If you don't give a good god damn about attention to detail, and you like a mediocre, violent spectacle that comes to a grinding hault for frequent and irritating character drama, this might just be the series for you
 Also, the production design was actually quite fascinating, so if that's something that interests you, watch an episode or two

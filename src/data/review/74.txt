Long time viewer of both Netflix and K-dramas, and this one is a fantastic blend of the best of both
 The amazing, succinct story-telling from Korean dramas plus the uncensored gore, cursing, and production quality of a Netflix original
 This show is unpredictable, well written, well acted, and extremely unique
 When I initially saw the premise/trailer I thought it was going to be a copy of Alice in Borderland, and while there are similarities, there are a ton of differences that made each one unique (I liked Squid Game better)
For the love of all that is holy, PLEASE watch the original Korean language version with subtitles
 The dub actors did okay, but the speech and inflection nuances are left out
 Plus the English dub seems to go off the subtitles rather than the actual language, (I can understand some Korean) so there are definitely some liberties taken that change the meaning/tone of certain scenes and characters
For those who are complaining about the VIP's: yep, that is a trademark of K-dramas, using bad actors for the English/foreign characters
 I recognized some from other K-dramas, and their acting is unfortunately stiff and subpar
 Perhaps now that the show is so popular and may even get a second season, future foreign characters will be played by decent actors
Either way, this show is a great, gory thriller that has a thought-provoking underlying message: what would you be willing to do for money?

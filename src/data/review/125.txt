First off: the idea with child games contests leading to death has been done before in Takashi Miikes "Kamisama no iu tì²™ri
" It almost feel a bit shameful how they just lifted that idea from that movie and especially from a so known director
Second: I mostly have experience with South Korean horror movies and i've always thought that South Korean acting was more realistic and western compared to the more theatrical overacted Japanese and Chinese, but the acting in Squid Game definitely feels more theatrical, which is not a good thing imo
 It's hard to connect with the story and the actors when they're expressing every emotion with shouting, flailing their arms and making exaggerated faces
 This might be a cultural thing and obviously people like that kind of acting in Asia, but i prefer the realistic kind
Third: The VIPs


 Listen, South Korean movie makers: Stay away from "actors" from the West who moves to SK to try their luck because they were unemployable on the Western market
 They were horrible
 Just terrible
Finally: Squid Game could've been compressed to three hours and still lend lots of time for character development, interactions, the games, the B plot and everything else
 This series was way way WAY too drawn out and got constantly stuck in all these overacted scenes with drawn out emotions
 The games wasn't fun (and we've seen it before) and once again; got stuck, drawn out and boring

I have no complaints about the story of Squid Game or the violence and gore in the story, it's actually done rather tactfully throughout, showing just enough here and there to make it worthwhile and fun to watch
The acting is top form in all respects, every portrayal is perfect and heart-wrenching in places in both how perfectly its shown and how decent it's made 
Even the sets are painstakingly jarring and off-putting, that
 "relativity" style primary colour hallway set is so jarringly off-putting and decently alluring at the same time, I knew on first seeing it that I'd love the set decoration and propworks
So why after all this gushing for how wonderfully amazing this is am I not giving it a 10/10?Because I want this series to be literally just this, a 9 episode story of a down-on-his-luck man with decent ambitions who goes through hell only to come out on the other side as a hero
But that ending man, that ending


the sequel bait in it is thick as 10 week in the snow syrup
 And I don't want that, I don't want Gi-hun to become some warrior trying to take down the international Squid Game people
 Let this be the amazing single season it is that shows even the lowest man can become something amazing when given the chance

This show got a lot of buzz when it came out and after a lot of people pressuring me to tell them what I think about it, I did so
 It isn't very long and it manages to keep you wanting to see what comes next, so in case you are looking for something thrilling you can marathon in a single day it's a good choice
 That's what I did and I had a lot of fun with how stupid it was
 Sure, it's a death game type of show, which means you are watching it for the spectacle of people dying by the hundreds over petty reasons
 This doesn't mean they don't need to have a decent plot you can follow without eyerolling all the time
 I don't expect a good reason for why the police don't get suspicious when hundreds of people disappear at once or the banks don't care when a poor man's account all of a sudden has a ridiculous amount of money
 It is the structure of the games that make you dumber the more you think about it
For starters what kind of a game doesn't let you know the rules and the penalties before beginning to play, so you will know what is at stake? Half of the players got killed in the first game alone because they panicked when they saw they kill you when you lose
 This wouldn't have happened if they were told elimination means death
 It doesn't matter if we the audience knew it was
 The characters in game didn't
 When you see people getting shot to death right next to you and you weren't told why beforehand, running away to hide is a completely normal reaction
Also you can't have the frontman saying the game is fair and everyone has the same chances of winning when there is clearly favorism and nepotism
 The second game is randomly easier for some players and harder for others
 The protagonist is given a lot of aid in the third and fourth games just because the organizer liked him
 Not to mention how they tell them at first the winners can share the money amongst them and midway they change it to only one can stay alive and get all the money for himself
Without fair play it was impossible to care about any of the characters
 Whenever they show their personal lives it feels like vapid emotional manipulation, since you are never given any reason to assume they can win because they deserve it
 They are killed at random
 The best parts are when they can use some sort of strategy or to indirectly cheat the rules, but those moments are not many and don't matter in the longrun since the winner was predetermined
 Not only that, the last episode desperately tries to offer social commentary and to be deep about humanity and kindness
 It all falls flat on its face because it's too late to do anything about it, it is told to the predetermined winner, and is told by a guy who was fooling around and then pretended to be dead
This show is often compared to Kaiji and although there are similarities it is nowhere near as good
 Over there the players were told what is at stake right away and there was a lot more strategy and deception instead of gory deaths based on luck
 Losing didn't mean death and you could retry to play
 Squid Game is a dumb variant of death games and comes down to shocking deaths, hollow drama, and vapid criticism of capitalism
 As such it's nothing special in the longrun

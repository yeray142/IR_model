Wow this show had me on an emotional roller coaster
 It really makes you wonder could you really be that cold if you were in the same predicament
 I became invested in the main characters background stories and rooted for them throughout the entire competition
 The most heartbreaking scene was when Ali died he was very kind-hearted and the game was too cut throat
 I can't believe the old man was the chairman behind this operation

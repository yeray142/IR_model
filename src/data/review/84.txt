This is a great show at first i thought "Squid Game" what a awful name but i got tons of good recommendations to watch it so i did and it was GREAT!!! Acting was good and the plot wad always aligned you can pretty much but two and two together towards the end if your smart but for most who can your in for a big surprise anyway good show
 I recommend all to watch this masterpiece

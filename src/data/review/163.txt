It was very well acted 
 The male lead was excellent 
 I did figure out the main twist in the storyline , earlier on
 I'm eagerly waiting for series 2 
I've watched South Korean movies for a number of years and have always enjoyed them 
Their series Kingdom is fabulous too 
 Hollywood needs to learn from South Korea how to make good movies and series

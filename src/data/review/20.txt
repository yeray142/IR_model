I had fun binging for two days
 It's seems like a mashup of the Hunger Games, Saw, Bond villains and wacky Asian reality game show
 Very good character development
 I felt I knew the characters well halfway in the series
 The first two episodes are a little slow, then the show ramps up to speed
 The last episode is a tear jerker
 The weakest part, as many have said we're the VIPs
 It wasn't that their acting was bad, it was the screenplay dialogue was poorly written
It's certainly a different kind of watch most Americans are not used to
 But that's a good thing
 Netflix makes it easier to watch foreign content so that our cultural bobble burst and we get more diversely made content from around the globe

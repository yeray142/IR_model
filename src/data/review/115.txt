This show has some serious hype at the moment so I thought why not give it a go
 This series is such an interesting concept, it's like a blend of hunger games and saw with some real life elements thrown in as well as some interesting Asian quirks
 The way the show is set up just keeps you asking questions, the whole show is just a lot of questions really and it's great as it keeps your mind racing
 Once I'd started this series I couldn't stop as I just needed to know what was happening next! This show just keeps you hooked and I love it
 It's pretty emotional at times also, I didn't think I'd be so emotionally attached to these characters but by the end I was so engrossed and found myself really sad as certain characters were eliminated from the games
 Honestly believe the hype that this show has and give it a watch!

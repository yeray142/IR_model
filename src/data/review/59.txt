This was an interesting program but not as great as reviewers are making it sound
 This show is about a bunch of deadbeat gamblers who are offered an opportunity to play a game where they either win a lot of money or die a violent death
 Only deadbeat gamblers would take the option to play the game knowing only one person will ultimately survive to win the cash
 Basically the plot shows how morally bankrupt the world has become and to me that is just sad
 It isn't exciting and fun to watch hundreds of people die a bloody death
 The fact that so many people found this show to be great is really sad too

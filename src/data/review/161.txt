and I couldn't even finish it
Maybe it gets good; I don't know, as it has so much hype and good reviews
I just know it's not for me
The main character is so unlikeable that I don't care what happens to him
 Maybe he grows as a character


he probably does, but I don't care enough to stick around to see
The acting is over the top
 The main character pulls faces every two minutes
 I've seen better acting in high school plays, but maybe a lot is missing in the translation
If I ever watch the rest I'll come back and write a better review but for now, this is a hard pass

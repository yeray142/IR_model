The first couple of episodes a very well done and pack a punch, but by the end it just seems to run out of steam
 The marbles episode was the last real swerve, after that it becomes paint by numbers to the point that I started fast forwarding through most of it just to get it to end
Early episodes are an eight, final episodes are a three

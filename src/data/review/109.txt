Very well done production
 It was like a modern day Twilight Zone
 Character development was excellent, music/score was spot on and like another important character, and story was well done
 It was creepy, chilling, bloody, touching, and emotional
 It had a little bit of everything
The very few complaints about it I do have don't outweigh the good points - The acting was a little over-done at times
 The voices and lines of the VIPs were way over-acted, the subtitles were very fast and hard to keep up with at times, and the last episode/ ending was just a little too bizarre - it took away from the good parts of the earlier episodes
But definitely watch it

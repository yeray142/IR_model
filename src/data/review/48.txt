Yes, it's like the Japanese game genres like Liars Game, Death Note


etc but much more interesting characters and social commentary
Yes, in its core a social experiment like Lord of the Flies but then the main character is from A Man for all Seasons
 The show basically ask do you have a price? The main guy, although a gambler, stayed true to himself as a nice person, believes in the goodness of humanity
 Even though he won, he was much troubled by the lives lost, disgusted by the money, and dumbfounded by the "reasoning" behind it all
001, the number one man(1% of the world?) is basically echoing the sentiment of "rosebud" from Citizen Kane and laments the place where adults can never return to


childhood
 But do you think Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson would have watched this show? (Maybe Elon Musk)
 Na, they have a space race to run
This is a great series
 Detail oriented, simple games, thoughtful interactions, tense and full of all the character arch (good, bad and ugly) of humanity
 Great cinematography, bgm score, character development, set, production and plot
The final game on the island is not a game but a duel of values
 And ask again, will you true to yourself? Same with the last bet on his death bed from the old men
 But the irony is that he lost not only the bet but also his life
 Double irony that he didn't get to see the results
Do you believe in the goodness of humanity?

The production was done quite well
 Love the direction
 Cinematography was on point
 Actors did a good job
 That being said the story really starts to take a turn for the worst towards the end
 Branched storylines resulted in dead ends
 The failed attempt at trying to be artistic and deep was quite cringe worthy in the finale
 Would i watch S2? 50/50

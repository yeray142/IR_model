I liked it but the last few episodes were too slow so I had to watch them at 1
5X speed
 All in all, it is an odd and entertaining series nicely designed but not as unique as some claim
 I do not know if the actors were poorly directed, if they are bad at acting or if it is a cultural thing but I thought many of the characters were overacting
If you have seen The Hostel franchise, Funhouse, The Maze Runner, Battle Royale, the Saw franchise, you will recognize a lot in this series
 However, Squid Game stands out with its colorful design and imaginative theme and I liked it
 Definitely worth a shot

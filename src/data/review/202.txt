1-6 built strong momentum
Ep 7 brought in talkative bad English speaking actors that completely killed the mystery and the momentum the show was building
 The show would have been smarter to keep them all silent and have them look tough and mysterious
 The moment they started opening their mouths and started walking, they looked and sounded like average American Joes with average intelligence and an average strut
 The show died there
Ep 8 Predictable progression, predictable ending, boring
Ep 9 total waste of time
 Just drags on for too long

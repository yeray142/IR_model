This show sucked me in on the first episode
 The acting is superb and the plot is great
 The only issue is the VIPs, that's where the acting is bad and writing fell apart
 Luckily the VIPs are only in one episode so it doesn't ruin the entire series
 I binged this on Netflix after watching one episode
 Hoping for a season 2

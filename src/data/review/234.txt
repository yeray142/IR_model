Firsts things first, the series is really well made and has a very well thought and written story
Speaking of story, this one was super realistic in regards to what would happen if such a situation were to happen, the only 2 problems I had were thinking of a way someone could be that rich to afford such facilities and to buy a island for themselves while keeping everything unsuspicious
 Talking about unsuspicious, problem number 2 is how would 456 be kidnapped and no one would notice? Other than that I have no other critic to the story, well done, realistic and interesting
Image wise it is as impressive as a series gets
 The sceneries are beautifully well made
 Interesting camera angles for a series as well
Lastly I want to point something out, a technicality that I noticed (and like I noticed this one I might have missed many others or there might not even exist any other, I don't know)
 When they are at the Tug of War, when a team loses they all fall down the bridge
 I also noticed that it takes a few seconds for the blade to cut the rope
 If putted the pieces together then shouldn't the winning team fall down the bridge as well duo to the massive weight difference, especially when it's a team with 3 women vs one full of men and the team with the women wins (meaning the team with only men is heavier)?To finish, the series is not perfect but it is pretty damn high up there

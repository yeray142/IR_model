What's Good- Yes, concept and plot of this survival drama is not a new thing, but the way it conveys with conviction has no match
It is high intense drama of human emotions like fear, greed, worrying, anxiety and humanity
 Like in 'parasite', it again shows social inequality issues of South Korea
The series is a high-quality work and It's visuals are strong to build suspense very effectively
Recommending to watch original Korean audio with English subtitles
 And yes, it can be addictive one to binge watch!

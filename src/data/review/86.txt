I watched Episode 1 on the advice of someone who had seen the entire series, and they were absolutely right
 I was captured right away
 The series is filled with twists and turns to keep your head spinning and your mind guessing
 Beware, cause there is more than enough violence in the series, and yet there are also many stories of humanity that keep you caring about some of these characters, at the same time that you despise others
 Keep an eye out for the many subtle clues that precede future events
 You probably won't see them at first, but they are cleverly thrown in often
 The best thing about this series is the acting
 My mouth fell open at the quality of some of the performances
 There are true Emmy or Oscar level performances throughout the show
 One of the best series I've watched in a long time

One problem I am finding is with more asian made entertainment, now they get higher ratings by other asians simply because it's asian made
 Kind of defeats the purpose of users rating things if they will rate something higher if its from their country/their culture
I watched Squid Game with my wife (asian mind you) and while it was interesting, I didn't love it like some are
 It's yet another battle royale movie, just in a different style
 It's not horrible mind you, just nothing mind blowing
 Watch it once and will never watch it again kind of thing
This all said I also gave it a lower score for subtitles and English audio
 We watch things in whatever native language something is in and will read the subtitles
 But for starters there were many mistakes in the subtitles which change the context of certain scenes
 So unless you know Korean, you are likely getting a out of context version through the subs
And if you watch in English audio (I watched some of it out of curiosity)




 it is AWFUL
 Not only is half of what they are saying wrong, but there is almost no emotion in the dubbers voices
 I know some don't like having to constantly look down to read subtitles, but trust me, the regular Korean track gives you WAY more emotion

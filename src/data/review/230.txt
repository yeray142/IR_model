Anwar Says : Last week, there was absolutely nothing to watch on Hindi OTT and I decided to go for much talked about Squid Game on Netflix, a Korean dark and disturbing series
 9 long episodes and would force you for a binge watch
You have everything in the plot , childhood games , killing, inhumanity, hatred , emotions, sentiments , and above all mind game 
 Out of 456 contestants, all down with debts are ready to sacrifice their lives to earn money, sounds a familiar subject but the Netflix team has converted it to unnerving deadly battle
Premise is simple and the characters are introduced quite fast but smoothly
 If you loose you are killed and your guessing is not correct every time
 Don't want to be a spoiler, so not narrating the story and the games 
The lead Lee Jung- Jae gets answers to all his questions in the last episode
Watch the series with sub- titles on , in spite of the fact the dubbing in English is of quality par excellence 
 The masked jump- suits used by the guards are going to be the favourite this Halloween 
 Already running at top spot since a fortnight
9 out of 10 from me

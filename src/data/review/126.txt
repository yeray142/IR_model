I was blown away when I first started watching this, but as the series went on it got a bit tedious, and some of the acting was terrible, especially from the woman who had the lighter, she almost made me want to abandon the whole series
There is some good acting though, and the idea of the series is very good and interesting
I'd like this to be re-made by the Americans, I think it would definitely be interesting

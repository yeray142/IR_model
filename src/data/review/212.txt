Ok

it's entertaining for sure


but plot wise it does not make sense

at the end ( spoilers)
 It's about how can they treat people the way they do

 forgetting the fact the contestants chose to be there and could leave anytime they liked

they knew the rules and decided to play 

so why the suddeb blame on the host of the games?

all in all it's fun

 expect a few remakes from bigger better film studios

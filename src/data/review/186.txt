I found this drama to be well executed and entertaining
Were there bad plot holes?Yes
Did the VIPs episode suck?Yes
But did that hinder the overall series?No
Because, this drama, despite its gruesome violence, is pretty light
 It doesn't have a deeper message nor a plot that makes you stop and think a lot
 At one point, it's just a game and you even stop feeling for whoever that dies
Pros:
Good actingThe childish games with a twist were funLight plot, easy to follow
Uncomplicated charactersStellar castCons:
VIPs episodePoliceman's story line, how he gets into a highly secured center being undetected was unrealistic, also how come his phone battery lasted for 6 days without dying?Characters did not have much depth (except for the girls and Ali)Anyway, I have been watching kdrama for a while now, and I should say Squid Game is not the best kdrama I have seen
 But it definitely is not the worst
 It's a fun ride
 With awesome OSTs and BGs
 Everyone should check this out

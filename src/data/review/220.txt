Squid Game deserves its hype overall but is still marred by glaring inconsistencies and poor story-telling
 One can infer from the focus on Gi Hun as the protagonist that he would at least make it to the final game, if not win it
 It would have been better had they given 10 mins in the first episode to tell the backstories of Gi Hun, Sang Woo, Sae Byeok, Ali, Deok Su and Mi Hyeon, so that it would appear each of them have an equal chance at winning
 Seven more things that compromise the story are:1
 The organ harvesters planned their entire operation down to the cremation furnace with a floor that dropped the coffin to a room below
 Yet they did not arrange a surgeon to pose as a staff member and instead relied on a player to dissect the bodies in exchange for information about the next game
2
 The Front Man is Jun Ho's missing older brother
 You would think he could have just lied to his younger brother about his whereabouts and paid in advance for his rent
 Why was he even renting a place or running Squid Game if he was the winner from 2015 and supposedly had all that prize money?3
 With the conclusion of Game 5, the glass bridge is blown to tiny smithereens and the glass shard that hits Sae Byeok is the size of a kitchen knife?4
 A less-than-convincing melee between Sang Woo and Gi Hun in the final game
 Gi Hun is unable to finish the game and eliminate Sang Woo
 Sang Woo suddenly finds his conscience and kills himself
 This is completely inconsistent to the person who sacrificed anyone in his way to get ahead
 What an anticlimax
5
 Gi Hun mopes about due to survivor's guilt, leaving Sang Woo's mom saddled with her son's debt and Sae Byeok's brother languishing in the orphanage for a whole year
6
 Squid Game started in 1988
 Hundreds of people disappear from Seoul in the same month every year and it raises no eyebrows
 Collective missing person reports would trigger police looking into CCTV footage of these people and they would come across footage of the Squid Games recruiters
7
 The final scene sees Gi Hun turning away from boarding his flight to see his daughter in America
 Presumably to try and get into the next Squid Games
 How exactly? They know who he is and what he looks like
 If he wishes to blow the lid on the game, he could have taken the card to the police, have them track down the original owner of the card and listen in as the invitee calls the Squid Game coordinator
 End scene
 Better set-up for season 2 instead of some irresponsible father letting his kid down again

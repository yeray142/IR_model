With a premise similar to the likes of Cube and Circle, the odd titled Squid Game helps us question humanity all over again as well as the importance society places on money
As dark and violent as Battle Royal and intriguing as 3% it grabs your attention early on and keeps you guessing to the end
Great binge worthy series with a likeable cast and main protagonist
Knocked off one point as I didn't love the ending but otherwise a really great TV series with some great ideas and worthy of top marks
Season 2? Personally I think it works better as a one off but then again

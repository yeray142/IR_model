IMO, this is a really well done production
 Some aspects get lost in translation (cultural, not language) but it's a well told story, regardless
 It's not an original story but a twist on an old classic
 What makes it entertaining for western countries like the US is the excellent dubbing
 You can't google translate this stuff
 It takes someone(s) who understands both the language, the culture, and the pop culture otherwise it's a huge speed bump in the entertainment value
 All of the dialog and acting value is in the dubbing, not the writing or the actors themselves
 Well, the ones on screen
 The dubbing actors did a great job as well as the translators
But, what's glaringly obvious is the racial aspect
 That is, throughout most of the story, all of the characters are korean except one who is pakistani
 But then we get to the VIPs that everyone is complaining about and all of them are non-korean
 In fact, it seems intentionally directed to Gweilos, the slur for white people in asia, and also anything western
 A number of people are complaining about the bad acting by the VIPs without realizing that these scenes are probably dubbed too
 So the slurs are intentional
 Maybe a complicated inside joke by someone(s) making a political or cultural statement

It could have been great - human selfishness exposed through worst excesses of capitalism, emotional struggles and ridiculously tough life and death choices, great sets, plenty of villains and drama
Instead, it is so unbelievably full of plot holes that it could only work as a parody, perhaps even really well
 Unfortunately, Squid Game takes itself more seriously than a 19th century psychiatrist
 It oozes heaviness and deep philosophy that its clownishly overacting cast (VIPs are the least of the show's problems) just cannot bear out

To be honest, it's cliche, nonsensible & horrible art-design
 Whole storyline is quite boring
 We can see the aim-system bypassed the old man at the very beginning, and we know there's something on it
It get the high ratings, but beneath it's not a bad tv drama series, and that's all of it - just a not-bad one

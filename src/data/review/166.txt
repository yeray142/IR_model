My biggest problems was how main character has been portrayed
 He was detestable
 First 10 minutes of the show and I really, really, really wanted to punch the guy in the face and turn off the show
The show kinda uses dirty trick to make him less what he was portrayed as and more relatable
 This effect was the strongest on 6th episode, Gganbu, which was also the best one out of all 9
In all honesty i had to force myself to watch first 3 episodes and they totally failed to hook me in
 I only kept on watching because otherwise i'd feel like I wasted 3 hours for nothing
 Sunk cost fallacy
I am kind of glad that I did
 Kind of
At episode 5 things got slightly better
 6th was the best, the peak of the show and after that it was slow and weird fall
 Yeah, episode 7, 8 and 9 were weird to say the least
The issues: The playgrounds and props look cheap
 Director tried to imitate 'hunger games'


 things (episode 7 onwards) but


 boy, oh boy

 It's just bad
 Fake blood was downright insulting

 While some scenes were brutally real
 Like DUDE, decide
 Want me to be grossed out with fake CGI blood stain, or puke my guts out?!The games are weird and some of them make little sense difficulty-wise, while others are made so unfair I just scratch my head "what was the point other than playing SAW movie on us?"
 Seriously some of those games a blender with nails and glass would be safer place than whatever they came up with
Ending, without any spoilers


 Here's the thing: Koreans to my knowledge LOVE unhappy/sad endings
 It seems they just need to be beaten down emotionally
 I seriously do not remember the last Korean movie that didn't end up sad for the sake of sad
 And because it's a 9-episode long show, the "sad ending" phase is stretched quite a bit
 Not gonna lie, I did feel like my eyes got teary, but it was annoying, rather than earned
Should you watch it


 Did you like saw (and/or dont mind gore)? If so, go ahead
 Do you have netflix? If so


 eh, sure
I wish i could just tell you to watch episode 6

 but without knowing the characters and their relationship


 Eh it's either all or none case, sadly
 I will definitely not bother with season 2 if we ever gonna get one

This is a good show; the concept is good, the acting from the main cast is solid, it deserves to be watched by the masses
But; it's not a great show


 it has some plot holes, as well as some terrible acting by the American characters (I won't include any spoilers, but I guarantee you'll know what I mean)All I've seen these past few weeks is the serious hype surrounding the show, and as someone who is a bit of a film buff, it needed an honest review
 Go watch it, you'll enjoy it, but please don't claim it as the best show ever

Squid Game had one of the best concepts, with mystery around few people who participates in a game with millions to win
 The story is simple yet creative and it works most of the entire series
The start was strong, with violence and bloodshed during the games which built an intense environment to leave us guessing what would happen next
The story went through well with a good last episode as well
 But it still felt that it was not finished as it should have been ended, with an open ending hinting for Season 2 (Although I would have preferred this to end in a single season)

Squid Game is another bullet in the chamber against streaming television
What other, also terrible films ("would you rather" immediately comes to mind) have managed to do in 2 hours, Squid Game takes 9 to draw the same conclusion: people suck when money is involved
Hundreds of people down on their luck agree to take part in a series of games with an unannounced prize fee
 After a few hundred are shot down in a game of "red light, green light" they get told every life is worth quite a lot of cash
 Gi-Hun, Sang,Wool and Sa-Beok are our eyes as they go through the tortures and trials of the whims of the rich, hounded by the poor
Nothing here is new
 The twists have all been done, the characters are all so broadly drawn that their motivations are unreasonable except in service of a story
 The conclusions, as to why they're playing children's games, and why it's all happening, might offer some comfort, but it's all nonsensical
 Scenes that could have given understanding to why one manipulative shrew eventually sacrifices herself and another for the good of the survivors would have been favourable to repeat scenes of endless people in tracksuits walking up and down stairs
 Giving us a true villain in the game with a counter POV for the final games would have set up a much better war of ideologies in an uncaring society than two sides of the same coin and an emotional bond that had been severed several episodes previously
 Having an omniscient operator accuse a player of cheating and ruining the "equality" of the game is laughable, when you consider the same faceless man does everything in his power to handicap adept players, and ensure as many people as possible die in unfair circumstances as possible
The Korean actors are all swell, but it's so difficult to comprehend how they chose the foreigners who appear in the final few episodes
 They sound like they're badly dubbed, and even though they wear masks, their performances are stiff as the gold encrusted animals they wear

 Netflix needs to stop financing every poorly thought out idea they land on, and begin considering quality over content

Squid Game has a very high body count, and lots of gore to go with it
 But even while the blood is spattering, the focus is on the characters, their relationships with each other, and the mysteries they're unraveling
 The attention to detail in every aspect of the series elevates it from enjoyable and entertaining to truly exceptional
The sets in the Game are mostly simple, with a childish surreality
 Yet also artfully designed for the impact that they have, and exquisitely memorable
Usually when the acting is good, we don't notice or think about it
 But there were several times that actors displayed their emotions which such perfectly controlled subtlety that you have to stop to admire it: the uncontrollably trembling chin of an actor pushing himself to the edge of tears to do honor to the scene, or an actor's blank face with the character's emotions "betrayed" by only the twitching of one eye
Needless to say, the directing and production must have also been top-notch to create these scenes and put them together to tell such a simple but compelling story
 The emotional impact is also carefully crafted: somehow, in the midst a huge number of violent deaths, the audience is left sobbing for half of an episode as both developed and undeveloped characters face impending death
And ultimately, there is a fairly clear moral to the story
 But that will have more impact if it's seen and felt, instead of described here

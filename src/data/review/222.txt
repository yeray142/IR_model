The main character is a foolish, clueless, impulsive, emotionally self-indulgent jerk
Other characters, flawed but fundamentally good people, die getting him back to the real world with that 45
6B won (~40M USD), but what does he do for the first year of having all that money? Does he help any of the loved ones left behind by those people who died getting him there with all that money?No, he leaves them all hanging, suffering for another year in the circumstances that were so bad it caused those good people who died saving him to go into and then back into that bloody Hell to try to save them
And then what does he do when he decides to go after the people behind the game? He calls them up and threatens them, making sure they know he's an enemy to be removed
He's a very unpleasant, impulsive and judgmental fool
 Fortunately, although he's clearly the main character from start to finish, he doesn't dominate too much screen time, and there are plenty of other characters to enjoy watching 



 although they pretty much all die

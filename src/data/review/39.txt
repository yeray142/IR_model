This is a great show to binge watch, even if it doesn't introduce anything all that new and original
The fact that it isn't American made means that it's one show that Netflix couldn't poison with its toxic political agendas
 It's just the vision of its creators - and that's fresh nowadays
I know people complain about the ending, but if you watch Alice in Borderlands (which you should, it's also a great show, Japanese this time) you'll know what a bad ending really is
 That show didn't end with any conclusion
But Squid Game, trust me, it will have more seasons due to its success, but even if it didn't, it ended nicely, pretty much answering most questions and delivering good conclusions to everything
 If anything, I believe more seasons would ruin this, but let's see what happens
In any case, the hype is real, this is a good show you should watch, just don't expect groundbreaking character development or much originality
 The characters are mostly cliches we've seen before, and so is the concept of deadly games
But, again, the standards are low nowadays, and this show is just captivating and interesting enough to raise above everything else there is to watch right now

This show had the potential to be one of the best foreign mini series ever streamed world wide, maybe it is for some but not for me since the flaws it kept having but covered by the unexpectd shocking events and great actors, the final episode is the reason not to give this show a 9 or 10, the worst plot twist ever happened and ruined it to be a perfect masterpiece, season 2 isn't necessary but seems like it's happening anyway

Let me keep it straight
Squid Game has a better cinematography (see the color contrast!!!) but Alice in the Borderland is way darker (n thus better, personally) as a thriller and horror series
 I dunno why but Japanese directors are more capable of creating stunning gore effects and death/necro scenes
 Which is to say, If u can't stand the horror and jump-scare of Alice in the Borderland, then Squid Game is the one more u
 It is visually mild in every aspects, plus a warmer story to make u feel easier
Back to Squid Game, I think it's not something original and groundbreaking
 As a survival horror series it is too warm, too humane
 The baddies are not that bad (at all!!)
 Finally, why there is always a super clean-n-tidy, pale skin, "handsome", smart, literate, elite entrepreneur young prince???? Where is the alpha-male?????!!!!!!

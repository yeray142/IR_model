Sorry
 That's a crude summation of this brilliant series
 It's a brutal, tense satire on the economic systems we are all trapped in
 Would those who lose most at the game, who gamble and get into debt far beyond what they can repay as wage slaves, would they risk their lives to be free? Of course; they would play the Squid Game
Motivations and characters are carefully fleshed out
 The concept of the games we play as children having life & death consequences in adult life is intelligently, deviously developed
 It combines quality, international art house drama style with thrills & bloody horror
 If you're ready for something challenging and intense play the Squid Game

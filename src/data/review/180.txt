It's a watchable series but not something that will make me watch a season 2
 The cast is great, acting is good (except for the English speaking VIPs wearing masks)
 The personal stories of the contestants and how they interact between each other make the series more human than just a survival game
 It does get bloody and somewhat violent as most survival game films do
 So, one season is good enough for me

But there were some plot holes
 The cop should have been caught ten times before he died but he magically escaped or the scene just went out
Also, I never understood the organ harvester, where he came from and how he was able to ply his trade


But I really enjoyed the series except of a couple of the later episodes where there was an inordinate amount of blah blah blah

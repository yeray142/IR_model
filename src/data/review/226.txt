I have to agree with others: I really didn't like the last three episodes and the wrap-up was dissatisfying
 "Gganbu" was one of the strongest episodes in an emotional perspective, yet the last episodes tracked back with the reveal of the "one" behind everything on one of the most interesting relationships they set up through the entirety of the show
They also left one of the most interesting characters who had so much potential completely behind, Sae-byeok, and completely invalidated the sacrifice of Ji-yeong and the impact of their scene - which was a shame
The VIP's were stereotypes, horrible actors, and extremely unnecessary
 I hated every second on screen they appeared and their absolutely dumb commentary
Up until Episode 7, I would have given it a 9 or 10
 Episode 7 onwards was a 4 for me
 10+4 / 2 = 7 stars overall

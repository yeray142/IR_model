Overall I love the show
 Great story, of the games
 Few things I don't like



the acting is sub par and feels scripted
 And the main character, you wanna like the main character
 And I don't, he's a sleazy Grambling addict who is really a piece of garbage
 I dont care whether he makes it or not
 And overall this show makes Koreans seem



cringy
 Horrible people

I started watching this series having heard that it is one of the most successful Netflix series ever produced
 It was definitely a great series
 The treatment, social message etc were great
 Kinda reminded me of a movie I watched called Platform
 But i would stop short of calling it the best
 The concept might have been given a bit different treatment but at the end it was still akin to an escape room
 The scenario under which the participants come back also sounds far fetched
 Ok there could be a lot of difficulties and hardships in the outside world but would someone want to go back to a place risking their lives where they are 99% sure to die
 But the show depicts that the people once left the show first time they were so desperate for money that they came back irrespective of the dangers there
 Not so believable according to me
 The reasoning of the old man why he conducted this game was also kind of ridiculous
 But all fine in the name of fiction
 Loved the characters otherwise

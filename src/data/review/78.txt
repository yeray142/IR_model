Nothing new here but it's quite well done and engaging
 There's more story and character development than you might expect from this story and that keeps it from just being generic
 As with many shows, the English dubbing is bad: if recommend original Korean with subtitles
 One nice thing is that because this is a series and not a movie, they're able to dig into the backstories more and that makes it more engaging and interesting than this may have otherwise been
 A great addition to the genre

This show isn't as amazing as everyone is making it out to be
 It's definitely entertaining to watch, but it doesn't have any more substance to it than that
 Maybe because I've watched this after the "raging hype", but I personally don't think this is a new concept at all
The acting is decent and it's filmed well, but my rating went down from 7 to 6, due to the explanation we're given as to why the games exist in the first place
Perhaps a lot of the viewers haven't seen Battle Royal and generation Z have only just discovered violent asian cinema

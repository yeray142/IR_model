I mean, I'd say I liked The Hunger Games better - but not The Maze Runner
 There's a real grimness to The Squid Games
 Like The Platform
 With every episode you're ground down deeper just like these poor saps who find themselves there
 I liked it well enough though it was long and the characters pretty familiar to this genre
 It does makes many apt comments about contemporary society - Ali's story is particularly sad as is Sae- Byeok's and the way we treat people just seeking a better life
 I can't say I get the uproar of the series - Netflix's potential biggest- but it's worth a watch if you like dystopian stuff - and who doesn't?

When I first heard about Squid Game I thought it was really out there
 After watching it, I still have that belief
 I like the premise of Squid Game, and I think most of the show is pretty good
 The games are fun, you learn to care about the players, and the setting is eerie
 I did not really understand the whole organ harvesting side plot, and it seemed unnecessary
 The twist at the end was pretty good, but relating everything back to betting on horses was not a good comparison
 I'm excited to see if this show will return for another season

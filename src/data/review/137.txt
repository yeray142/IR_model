The luckiest unlucky? The question, what does success mean to you? Just try to ask yourself after watching it
 What a brilliant, dark, fun & fast paced show to demonstrate metaphor of capitalism
 I would love to take this ride again
 Excellent showcase of human mind and emotions
 The acting was pretty good and the story & plot was crazy
 Its the battle of strong people against the weak people covering all aspects such as morality, honesty, sacrifice, smartness, cunningness and so on
 Ending was somewhat predictable bht definitely a good show
 I do recommend for you to watch it

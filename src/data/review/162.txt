I feel conflicted after finishing the series
 After watching the 3rd episode I was hooked! Just absolutely amazing! A solid 10! I'm glad there were only 9 episodes
 At this moment I'm not sure exactly when it started going wrong
 I agree with others, the VIPs were awful and cliche
 And regardless of how much you are into the game you wouldn't sit for hours with such heavy gold masks on! They were beautiful but completely distracting with the awful dialogue
 The final episode was very disappointing
 After winning the game, they throw him unconscious onto the street
 I don't understand why they would stuff the bank card in his mouth
 Makes no sense
 Fast forward a year later and Gi-hun is a mess
 He hadn't yet honored the promise he made to Kang about her younger Brother
 Okay fine
 And he finds out Il-Nam, the old man is still alive, which was good and bad
 We never saw him die, but the reunion didn't work for me
 Turns out Il-Nam is responsible for the game
 Regardless, after he passes for real, Gi-hun appears to get his act together
 He goes to a hair salon and dyes his hair bright pink! Why? I'm sorry I didn't find it funny or necessary
 Then he visits and adopts? Kang's brother but dumps him and a load of cash with the dead 'Big Bad's' Mother! THEN it looks like he's going fly and see his son in the US but after an incident and a phone call he turns around with the look of- I'm headed back to the game? Maybe if this had been done differently I'd feel satisfied
 But what started as a freaking great show, left a sour taste in my mouth
 Sigh

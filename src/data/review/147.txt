The Squid game is probably one of the best shows I have seen in a long long time
 It sure knows how to play around with the viewer's emotions
 It will make you fall in love with some of the characters and then break your heart by killing them off in creative ways
Its a tough show to watch simply because you will be fully invested and immersed well enough into the story for it to make an impact on you
Great Character development - CheckPerfect Casting - CheckPerfect screenplay and progression - CheckA brilliant show that is a must watch, that will make you root for the characters, cry for them and generally start to question their morality, motivations and choices
And that's what the show is all about
 The ethical choices we have to make just to be selfish, just to survive one more day in this cruel cruel world
I will not give away the plot but would instead implore you to watch the show by yourself and form your own opinions

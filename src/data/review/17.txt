Not sure about all the hype but certainly great fun and slickly made
Nothing really new in the plot
 Rich bored gamblers making desperate humans kill each other for their enjoyment
I guess the difference between this and so many before is the excellent character development and talented acting
 Direction, cinematography all good
 I think Alice in Borderland was slightly more adventurous but this was certainly slicker
A great binge watch!

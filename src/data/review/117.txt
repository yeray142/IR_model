Every aspect of Squid Game is done almost to perfection
 The character development is perfect and draws you into the contestants lives
 You end up genuinely caring about many of them
The show is vibrant and fresh with dark undertones leaving you feeling unsettled throughout
The ending seems slightly forced but not enough to diminish this exceptional piece of work

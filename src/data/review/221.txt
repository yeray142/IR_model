I watched two episodes and I had enough
 There's nothing here, terrible acting, unoriginal concept (I've seen a half dozen movies that resemble this series)
 I honestly do not understand what the hype is about, the only thing I can guess is that the producers and Netflix paid a huge amount of money to market this show
 I see a LOT of Stanley Kubrik wanna be here, from the masks (Eyes Wide Shut), the music (On the Beautiful Blue Danube) the surrealism (The Shining), the gore (A Clockwork Orange), and there is nothing wrong with being influenced or even try to imitate art, however this series is simply too weak and Kubrik's imitation is a failure in my opinion
 If anyone is impressed by this then they must be watching reality TV all day long

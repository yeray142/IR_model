What a beautiful surprise we got here, Netflix usually makes cheap content, like in budget and in creativity, but this is one of the few great things Netflix release per year, like The OA or La casa de papel, Ozark etc
The quality of the script is top pitch perfect, as the characters construction, absolutely great games, very unpredictable, and the teams are more like a chess game, it doesn't matter if u have the strongest team in a tug of war, if u have a genius, an old wise man, fearless integrants, you can rock the way out of any situation, this show grew on me, I LOVED IT

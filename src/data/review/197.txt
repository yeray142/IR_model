What's with all the hype??My biggest problem with this are the characters
 I just don't care for them, very two dimensional and not very well drawn
The concept is nothing ground breaking
 Seen it done before and better
 Also don't bother with the dubbed audio, you'll end up laughing
Found myself bored in quite a few of the episodes also
Overall, I just didn't care, not the worst thing I've ever seen but nowhere's near worthy of the hype it received

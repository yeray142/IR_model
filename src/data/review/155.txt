I am the first to admit I'm a lazy movie watcher and am not big on dubbing foreign movies or subtitles so when I kept hearing about Squid Game I was hesitant
This movie was amazing and was such a well written and interesting story
I've seen others bag the VIPs and I agree that was the weakest point of the show but hard to fault anything else
Can't wait for season 2

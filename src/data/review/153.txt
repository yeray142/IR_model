It's more than just a show or very strange idea from South Korea's minds, slowly with the characters development there will be a lot of questions about life in general and especially about being a human or not


 and this is the strength of the show, yes as lot of viewers I didn't like that much the last 3 episodes mainly because of the introduction of some strangers





 otherwise it is a solid show

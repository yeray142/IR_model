Show was lame, very weirdly paced and slow
 It wasnt anything new or groundbreaking eithee
 Dont follow the hype either
 Idk why its even as popular as it is when there is much better out there
 Alice in boarderland is far better and much more intense
 You dont know wtf is goin to happen in that show
 This show was like escape room meets saw with battle royal but nowhere near as amazing as BR
 Skip this or watch if your bored

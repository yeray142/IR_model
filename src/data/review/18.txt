I don't know if it's a must for Netflix shows to become lame at the very end
 It became very far-fetched and melodramatic and Gi-hun signaled virtue the whole time as if he didn't get back to the game while he knew he had to kill people and as if he didn't cheat the old man at the marble game
 I wish he just stood up and admitted what he did
 His mother died and he helped the mother of the other finalist (that stabbed himself in the neck at the squid game) by giving her the money and then took the North Korean girl's brother from the orphanage and before flying to the US to see his daughter, he called the corporate again to make them pay back
 And another thing is that the old man was in fact the Korean Jigsaw in the game
 He was rich so he wanted to lose track of time just like he'd do when he was a child so he did all what he did
 And he died at an empty flat right before the sleeping old drunk man in the street received help just like Gi-hun
 He died a few seconds before midnight as if we needed more far-fetched stuff
I enjoyed the show except for the final episode
 The idea and the execution was good and the acting didn't take me out of it except for the actors who play American guests
 I like the characters and their background stories
 And on top of all this, there's this amazing episode 6 so I rated it 8 out of 10
